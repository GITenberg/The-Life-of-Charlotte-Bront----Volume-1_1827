<h1>THE LIFE OF CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;&mdash;VOLUME 1</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>The Leeds and Skipton railway runs along a deep valley of the Aire;
a slow and sluggish stream, compared to the neighbouring river of Wharfe.&nbsp;
Keighley station is on this line of railway, about a quarter of a mile
from the town of the same name.&nbsp; The number of inhabitants and
the importance of Keighley have been very greatly increased during the
last twenty years, owing to the rapidly extended market for worsted
manufactures, a branch of industry that mainly employs the factory population
of this part of Yorkshire, which has Bradford for its centre and metropolis.</p>
<p>Keighley is in process of transformation from a populous, old-fashioned
village, into a still more populous and flourishing town.&nbsp; It is
evident to the stranger, that as the gable-ended houses, which obtrude
themselves corner-wise on the widening street, fall vacant, they are
pulled down to allow of greater space for traffic, and a more modern
style of architecture.&nbsp; The quaint and narrow shop-windows of fifty
years ago, are giving way to large panes and plate-glass.&nbsp; Nearly
every dwelling seems devoted to some branch of commerce.&nbsp; In passing
hastily through the town, one hardly perceives where the necessary lawyer
and doctor can live, so little appearance is there of any dwellings
of the professional middle-class, such as abound in our old cathedral
towns.&nbsp; In fact, nothing can be more opposed than the state of
society, the modes of thinking, the standards of reference on all points
of morality, manners, and even politics and religion, in such a new
manufacturing place as Keighley in the north, and any stately, sleepy,
picturesque cathedral town in the south.&nbsp; Yet the aspect of Keighley
promises well for future stateliness, if not picturesqueness.&nbsp;
Grey stone abounds; and the rows of houses built of it have a kind of
solid grandeur connected with their uniform and enduring lines.&nbsp;
The frame-work of the doors, and the lintels of the windows, even in
the smallest dwellings, are made of blocks of stone.&nbsp; There is
no painted wood to require continual beautifying, or else present a
shabby aspect; and the stone is kept scrupulously clean by the notable
Yorkshire housewives.&nbsp; Such glimpses into the interior as a passer-by
obtains, reveal a rough abundance of the means of living, and diligent
and active habits in the women.&nbsp; But the voices of the people are
hard, and their tones discordant, promising little of the musical taste
that distinguishes the district, and which has already furnished a Carrodus
to the musical world.&nbsp; The names over the shops (of which the one
just given is a sample) seem strange even to an inhabitant of the neighbouring
county, and have a peculiar smack and flavour of the place.</p>
<p>The town of Keighley never quite melts into country on the road to
Haworth, although the houses become more sparse as the traveller journeys
upwards to the grey round hills that seem to bound his journey in a
westerly direction.&nbsp; First come some villas; just sufficiently
retired from the road to show that they can scarcely belong to any one
liable to be summoned in a hurry, at the call of suffering or danger,
from his comfortable fireside; the lawyer, the doctor, and the clergyman,
live at hand, and hardly in the suburbs, with a screen of shrubs for
concealment.</p>
<p>In a town one does not look for vivid colouring; what there may be
of this is furnished by the wares in the shops, not by foliage or atmospheric
effects; but in the country some brilliancy and vividness seems to be
instinctively expected, and there is consequently a slight feeling of
disappointment at the grey neutral tint of every object, near or far
off, on the way from Keighley to Haworth.&nbsp; The distance is about
four miles; and, as I have said, what with villas, great worsted factories,
rows of workmen&rsquo;s houses, with here and there an old-fashioned
farmhouse and out-buildings, it can hardly be called &ldquo;country&rdquo;
any part of the way.&nbsp; For two miles the road passes over tolerably
level ground, distant hills on the left, a &ldquo;beck&rdquo; flowing
through meadows on the right, and furnishing water power, at certain
points, to the factories built on its banks.&nbsp; The air is dim and
lightless with the smoke from all these habitations and places of business.&nbsp;
The soil in the valley (or &ldquo;bottom,&rdquo; to use the local term)
is rich; but, as the road begins to ascend, the vegetation becomes poorer;
it does not flourish, it merely exists; and, instead of trees, there
are only bushes and shrubs about the dwellings.&nbsp; Stone dykes are
everywhere used in place of hedges; and what crops there are, on the
patches of arable land, consist of pale, hungry-looking, grey green
oats.&nbsp; Right before the traveller on this road rises Haworth village;
he can see it for two miles before he arrives, for it is situated on
the side of a pretty steep hill, with a back-ground of dun and purple
moors, rising and sweeping away yet higher than the church, which is
built at the very summit of the long narrow street.&nbsp; All round
the horizon there is this same line of sinuous wave-like hills; the
scoops into which they fall only revealing other hills beyond, of similar
colour and shape, crowned with wild, bleak moors&mdash;grand, from the
ideas of solitude and loneliness which they suggest, or oppressive from
the feeling which they give of being pent-up by some monotonous and
illimitable barrier, according to the mood of mind in which the spectator
may be.</p>
<p>For a short distance the road appears to turn away from Haworth,
as it winds round the base of the shoulder of a hill; but then it crosses
a bridge over the &ldquo;beck,&rdquo; and the ascent through the village
begins.&nbsp; The flag-stones with which it is paved are placed end-ways,
in order to give a better hold to the horses&rsquo; feet; and, even
with this help, they seem to be in constant danger of slipping backwards.&nbsp;
The old stone houses are high compared to the width of the street, which
makes an abrupt turn before reaching the more level ground at the head
of the village, so that the steep aspect of the place, in one part,
is almost like that of a wall.&nbsp; But this surmounted, the church
lies a little off the main road on the left; a hundred yards, or so,
and the driver relaxes his care, and the horse breathes more easily,
as they pass into the quite little by-street that leads to Haworth Parsonage.&nbsp;
The churchyard is on one side of this lane, the school-house and the
sexton&rsquo;s dwelling (where the curates formerly lodged) on the other.</p>
<p>The parsonage stands at right angles to the road, facing down upon
the church; so that, in fact, parsonage, church, and belfried school-house,
form three sides of an irregular oblong, of which the fourth is open
to the fields and moors that lie beyond.&nbsp; The area of this oblong
is filled up by a crowded churchyard, and a small garden or court in
front of the clergyman&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; As the entrance to this
from the road is at the side, the path goes round the corner into the
little plot of ground.&nbsp; Underneath the windows is a narrow flower-border,
carefully tended in days of yore, although only the most hardy plants
could be made to grow there.&nbsp; Within the stone wall, which keeps
out the surrounding churchyard, are bushes of elder and lilac; the rest
of the ground is occupied by a square grass-plot and a gravel walk.&nbsp;
The house is of grey stone, two stories high, heavily roofed with flags,
in order to resist the winds that might strip off a lighter covering.&nbsp;
It appears to have been built about a hundred years ago, and to consist
of four rooms on each story; the two windows on the right (as the visitor
stands with his back to the church, ready to enter in at the front door)
belonging to Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s study, the two on the left to the
family sitting-room.&nbsp; Everything about the place tells of the most
dainty order, the most exquisite cleanliness.&nbsp; The door-steps are
spotless; the small old-fashioned window-panes glitter like looking-glass.&nbsp;
Inside and outside of that house cleanliness goes up into its essence,
purity.</p>
<p>The little church lies, as I mentioned, above most of the houses
in the village; and the graveyard rises above the church, and is terribly
full of upright tombstones.&nbsp; The chapel or church claims greater
antiquity than any other in that part of the kingdom; but there is no
appearance of this in the external aspect of the present edifice, unless
it be in the two eastern windows, which remain unmodernized, and in
the lower part of the steeple.&nbsp; Inside, the character of the pillars
shows that they were constructed before the reign of Henry VII.&nbsp;
It is probable that there existed on this ground, a &ldquo;field-kirk,&rdquo;
or oratory, in the earliest times; and, from the Archbishop&rsquo;s
registry at York, it is ascertained that there was a chapel at Haworth
in 1317.&nbsp; The inhabitants refer inquirers concerning the date to
the following inscription on a stone in the church tower:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic fecit C&aelig;nobium Monachorum Auteste fundator.&nbsp;
A. D. sexcentissimo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, before the preaching of Christianity in Northumbria.&nbsp;
Whitaker says that this mistake originated in the illiterate copying
out, by some modern stone-cutter, of an inscription in the character
of Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s time on an adjoining stone:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orate pro bono statu Eutest Tod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now every antiquary knows that the formula of prayer &lsquo;bono
statu&rsquo; always refers to the living.&nbsp; I suspect this singular
Christian name has been mistaken by the stone-cutter for Austet, a contraction
of Eustatius, but the word Tod, which has been mis-read for the Arabic
figures 600, is perfectly fair and legible.&nbsp; On the presumption
of this foolish claim to antiquity, the people would needs set up for
independence, and contest the right of the Vicar of Bradford to nominate
a curate at Haworth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have given this extract, in order to explain the imaginary groundwork
of a commotion which took place in Haworth about five and thirty years
ago, to which I shall have occasion to allude again more particularly.</p>
<p>The interior of the church is commonplace; it is neither old enough
nor modern enough to compel notice.&nbsp; The pews are of black oak,
with high divisions; and the names of those to whom they belong are
painted in white letters on the doors.&nbsp; There are neither brasses,
nor altar-tombs, nor monuments, but there is a mural tablet on the right-hand
side of the communion-table, bearing the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>HERE<br />
LIE THE REMAINS OF<br />
MARIA BRONT&Euml;, WIFE<br />
OF THE<br />
REV. P. BRONT&Euml;, A.B., MINISTER OF HAWORTH.<br />
HER SOUL<br />
DEPARTED TO THE SAVIOUR, SEPT. 15TH, 1821,<br />
IN THE 39TH YEAR OF HER AGE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the
Son of Man cometh.&rdquo;&nbsp; MATTHEW xxiv. 44.</p>
<p>ALSO HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF<br />
MARIA BRONT&Euml;, DAUGHTER OF THE AFORESAID;<br />
SHE DIED ON THE<br />
6TH OF MAY, 1825, IN THE 12TH YEAR OF HER AGE;<br />
AND OF<br />

<p>&ldquo;Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become

xviii. 3.</p>
<p>HERE ALSO LIE THE REMAINS OF<br />

YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF THE REV. P. BRONT&Euml;, A.B.<br />
SHE DIED, AGED 27 YEARS, MAY 28TH, 1849,<br />
AND WAS BURIED AT THE OLD CHURCH, SCARBORO.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the upper part of this tablet ample space is allowed between the
lines of the inscription; when the first memorials were written down,
the survivors, in their fond affection, thought little of the margin
and verge they were leaving for those who were still living.&nbsp; But
as one dead member of the household follows another fast to the grave,
the lines are pressed together, and the letters become small and cramped.&nbsp;
After the record of Anne&rsquo;s death, there is room for no other.</p>
<p>But one more of that generation&mdash;the last of that nursery of
six little motherless children&mdash;was yet to follow, before the survivor,
the childless and widowed father, found his rest.&nbsp; On another tablet,
below the first, the following record has been added to that mournful
list:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>ADJOINING LIE THE REMAINS OF<br />
CHARLOTTE, WIFE<br />
OF THE<br />
REV. ARTHUR BELL NICHOLLS, A.B.,<br />
AND DAUGHTER OF THE REV. P.&nbsp; BRONT&Euml;, A.B., INCUMBENT<br />
SHE DIED MARCH 31ST, 1855, IN THE 39TH<br />
YEAR OF HER AGE. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tablet, which corrects the error in the former tablet as to
the age of Anne Bront&euml;, bears the following inscription in Roman
letters; the initials, however, being in old English.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>For a right understanding of the life of my dear friend, Charlotte
Bront&euml;, it appears to me more necessary in her case than in most
others, that the reader should be made acquainted with the peculiar
forms of population and society amidst which her earliest years were
passed, and from which both her own and her sisters&rsquo; first impressions
of human life must have been received.&nbsp; I shall endeavour, therefore,
before proceeding further with my work, to present some idea of the
character of the people of Haworth, and the surrounding districts.</p>
<p>Even an inhabitant of the neighbouring county of Lancaster is struck
by the peculiar force of character which the Yorkshiremen display.&nbsp;
This makes them interesting as a race; while, at the same time, as individuals,
the remarkable degree of self-sufficiency they possess gives them an
air of independence rather apt to repel a stranger.&nbsp; I use this
expression &ldquo;self-sufficiency&rdquo; in the largest sense.&nbsp;
Conscious of the strong sagacity and the dogged power of will which
seem almost the birthright of the natives of the West Riding, each man
relies upon himself, and seeks no help at the hands of his neighbour.&nbsp;
From rarely requiring the assistance of others, he comes to doubt the
power of bestowing it: from the general success of his efforts, he grows
to depend upon them, and to over-esteem his own energy and power.&nbsp;
He belongs to that keen, yet short-sighted class, who consider suspicion
of all whose honesty is not proved as a sign of wisdom.&nbsp; The practical
qualities of a man are held in great respect; but the want of faith
in strangers and untried modes of action, extends itself even to the
manner in which the virtues are regarded; and if they produce no immediate
and tangible result, they are rather put aside as unfit for this busy,
striving world; especially if they are more of a passive than an active
character.&nbsp; The affections are strong and their foundations lie
deep: but they are not&mdash;such affections seldom are&mdash;wide-spreading;
nor do they show themselves on the surface.&nbsp; Indeed, there is little
display of any of the amenities of life among this wild, rough population.&nbsp;
Their accost is curt; their accent and tone of speech blunt and harsh.&nbsp;
Something of this may, probably, be attributed to the freedom of mountain
air and of isolated hill-side life; something be derived from their
rough Norse ancestry.&nbsp; They have a quick perception of character,
and a keen sense of humour; the dwellers among them must be prepared
for certain uncomplimentary, though most likely true, observations,
pithily expressed.&nbsp; Their feelings are not easily roused, but their
duration is lasting.&nbsp; Hence there is much close friendship and
faithful service; and for a correct exemplification of the form in which
the latter frequently appears, I need only refer the reader of &ldquo;Wuthering
Heights&rdquo; to the character of &ldquo;Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the same cause come also enduring grudges, in some cases amounting
to hatred, which occasionally has been bequeathed from generation to
generation.&nbsp; I remember Miss Bront&euml; once telling me that it
was a saying round about Haworth, &ldquo;Keep a stone in thy pocket
seven year; turn it, and keep it seven year longer, that it may be ever
ready to thine hand when thine enemy draws near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The West Riding men are sleuth-hounds in pursuit of money.&nbsp;
Miss Bront&euml; related to my husband a curious instance illustrative
of this eager desire for riches.&nbsp; A man that she knew, who was
a small manufacturer, had engaged in many local speculations which had
always turned out well, and thereby rendered him a person of some wealth.&nbsp;
He was rather past middle age, when he bethought him of insuring his
life; and he had only just taken out his policy, when he fell ill of
an acute disease which was certain to end fatally in a very few days.&nbsp;
The doctor, half-hesitatingly, revealed to him his hopeless state.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By jingo!&rdquo; cried he, rousing up at once into the old energy,
&ldquo;I shall <i>do</i> the insurance company!&nbsp; I always was a
lucky fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These men are keen and shrewd; faithful and persevering in following
out a good purpose, fell in tracking an evil one.&nbsp; They are not
emotional; they are not easily made into either friends or enemies;
but once lovers or haters, it is difficult to change their feeling.&nbsp;
They are a powerful race both in mind and body, both for good and for
evil.</p>
<p>The woollen manufacture was introduced into this district in the
days of Edward III.&nbsp; It is traditionally said that a colony of
Flemings came over and settled in the West Riding to teach the inhabitants
what to do with their wool.&nbsp; The mixture of agricultural with manufacturing
labour that ensued and prevailed in the West Riding up to a very recent
period, sounds pleasant enough at this distance of time, when the classical
impression is left, and the details forgotten, or only brought to light
by those who explore the few remote parts of England where the custom
still lingers.&nbsp; The idea of the mistress and her maidens spinning
at the great wheels while the master was abroad ploughing his fields,
or seeing after his flocks on the purple moors, is very poetical to
look back upon; but when such life actually touches on our own days,
and we can hear particulars from the lips of those now living, there
come out details of coarseness&mdash;of the uncouthness of the rustic
mingled with the sharpness of the tradesman&mdash;of irregularity and
fierce lawlessness&mdash;that rather mar the vision of pastoral innocence
and simplicity.&nbsp; Still, as it is the exceptional and exaggerated
characteristics of any period that leave the most vivid memory behind
them, it would be wrong, and in my opinion faithless, to conclude that
such and such forms of society and modes of living were not best for
the period when they prevailed, although the abuses they may have led
into, and the gradual progress of the world, have made it well that
such ways and manners should pass away for ever, and as preposterous
to attempt to return to them, as it would be for a man to return to
the clothes of his childhood.</p>
<p>The patent granted to Alderman Cockayne, and the further restrictions
imposed by James I. on the export of undyed woollen cloths (met by a
prohibition on the part of the States of Holland of the import of English-dyed
cloths), injured the trade of the West Riding manufacturers considerably.&nbsp;
Their independence of character, their dislike of authority, and their
strong powers of thought, predisposed them to rebellion against the
religious dictation of such men as Laud, and the arbitrary rule of the
Stuarts; and the injury done by James and Charles to the trade by which
they gained their bread, made the great majority of them Commonwealth
men.&nbsp; I shall have occasion afterwards to give one or two instances
of the warm feelings and extensive knowledge on subjects of both home
and foreign politics existing at the present day in the villages lying
west and east of the mountainous ridge that separates Yorkshire and
Lancashire; the inhabitants of which are of the same race and possess
the same quality of character.</p>
<p>The descendants of many who served under Cromwell at Dunbar, live
on the same lands as their ancestors occupied then; and perhaps there
is no part of England where the traditional and fond recollections of
the Commonwealth have lingered so long as in that inhabited by the woollen
manufacturing population of the West Riding, who had the restrictions
taken off their trade by the Protector&rsquo;s admirable commercial
policy.&nbsp; I have it on good authority that, not thirty years ago,
the phrase, &ldquo;in Oliver&rsquo;s days,&rdquo; was in common use
to denote a time of unusual prosperity.&nbsp; The class of Christian
names prevalent in a district is one indication of the direction in
which its tide of hero-worship sets.&nbsp; Grave enthusiasts in politics
or religion perceive not the ludicrous side of those which they give
to their children; and some are to be found, still in their infancy,
not a dozen miles from Haworth, that will have to go through life as
Lamartine, Kossuth, and Dembinsky.&nbsp; And so there is a testimony
to what I have said, of the traditional feeling of the district, in
the fact that the Old Testament names in general use among the Puritans
are yet the prevalent appellations in most Yorkshire families of middle
or humble rank, whatever their religious persuasion may be.&nbsp; There
are numerous records, too, that show the kindly way in which the ejected
ministers were received by the gentry, as well as by the poorer part
of the inhabitants, during the persecuting days of Charles II.&nbsp;
These little facts all testify to the old hereditary spirit of independence,
ready ever to resist authority which was conceived to be unjustly exercised,
that distinguishes the people of the West Riding to the present day.</p>
<p>The parish of Halifax touches that of Bradford, in which the chapelry
of Haworth is included; and the nature of the ground in the two parishes
is much the of the same wild and hilly description.&nbsp; The abundance
of coal, and the number of mountain streams in the district, make it
highly favourable to manufactures; and accordingly, as I stated, the
inhabitants have for centuries been engaged in making cloth, as well
as in agricultural pursuits.&nbsp; But the intercourse of trade failed,
for a long time, to bring amenity and civilization into these outlying
hamlets, or widely scattered dwellings.&nbsp; Mr. Hunter, in his &ldquo;Life
of Oliver Heywood,&rdquo; quotes a sentence out of a memorial of one
James Rither, living in the reign of Elizabeth, which is partially true
to this day:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have no superior to court, no civilities to practise:
a sour and sturdy humour is the consequence, so that a stranger is shocked
by a tone of defiance in every voice, and an air of fierceness in every
countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even now, a stranger can hardly ask a question without receiving
some crusty reply, if, indeed, he receive any at all.&nbsp; Sometimes
the sour rudeness amounts to positive insult.&nbsp; Yet, if the &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo;
takes all this churlishness good-humouredly, or as a matter of course,
and makes good any claim upon their latent kindliness and hospitality,
they are faithful and generous, and thoroughly to be relied upon.&nbsp;
As a slight illustration of the roughness that pervades all classes
in these out-of-the-way villages, I may relate a little adventure which
happened to my husband and myself, three years ago, at Addingham&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>From Penigent to Pendle Hill,<br />
From Linton to Long-<i>Addingham</i><br />
And all that Craven coasts did tell, &amp;c.&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>one of the places that sent forth its fighting men to the famous
old battle of Flodden Field, and a village not many miles from Haworth.</p>
<p>We were driving along the street, when one of those ne&rsquo;er-do-weel
lads who seem to have a kind of magnetic power for misfortunes, having
jumped into the stream that runs through the place, just where all the
broken glass and bottles are thrown, staggered naked and nearly covered
with blood into a cottage before us.&nbsp; Besides receiving another
bad cut in the arm, he had completely laid open the artery, and was
in a fair way of bleeding to death&mdash;which, one of his relations
comforted him by saying, would be likely to &ldquo;save a deal o&rsquo;
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my husband had checked the effusion of blood with a strap that
one of the bystanders unbuckled from his leg, he asked if a surgeon
had been sent for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoi,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but we dunna think he&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s owd, yo seen, and asthmatic, and it&rsquo;s up-hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My husband taking a boy for his guide, drove as fast as he could
to the surgeon&rsquo;s house, which was about three-quarters of a mile
off, and met the aunt of the wounded lad leaving it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he coming?&rdquo; inquired my husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didna&rsquo; say he wouldna&rsquo; come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, tell him the lad may bleed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, only, &lsquo;D-n him; what do I care?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It ended, however, in his sending one of his sons, who, though not
brought up to &ldquo;the surgering trade,&rdquo; was able to do what
was necessary in the way of bandages and plasters.&nbsp; The excuse
made for the surgeon was, that &ldquo;he was near eighty, and getting
a bit doited, and had had a matter o&rsquo; twenty childer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the most unmoved of the lookers-on was the brother of the boy
so badly hurt; and while he was lying in a pool of blood on the flag
floor, and crying out how much his arm was &ldquo;warching,&rdquo; his
stoical relation stood coolly smoking his bit of black pipe, and uttered
not a single word of either sympathy or sorrow.</p>
<p>Forest customs, existing in the fringes of dark wood, which clothed
the declivity of the hills on either side, tended to brutalize the population
until the middle of the seventeenth century.&nbsp; Execution by beheading
was performed in a summary way upon either men or women who were guilty
of but very slight crimes; and a dogged, yet in some cases fine, indifference
to human life was thus generated.&nbsp; The roads were so notoriously
bad, even up to the last thirty years, that there was little communication
between one village and another; if the produce of industry could be
conveyed at stated times to the cloth market of the district, it was
all that could be done; and, in lonely houses on the distant hill-side,
or by the small magnates of secluded hamlets, crimes might be committed
almost unknown, certainly without any great uprising of popular indignation
calculated to bring down the strong arm of the law.&nbsp; It must be
remembered that in those days there was no rural constabulary; and the
few magistrates left to themselves, and generally related to one another,
were most of them inclined to tolerate eccentricity, and to wink at
faults too much like their own.</p>
<p>Men hardly past middle life talk of the days of their youth, spent
in this part of the country, when, during the winter months, they rode
up to the saddle-girths in mud; when absolute business was the only
reason for stirring beyond the precincts of home, and when that business
was conducted under a pressure of difficulties which they themselves,
borne along to Bradford market in a swift first-class carriage, can
hardly believe to have been possible.&nbsp; For instance, one woollen
manufacturer says that, not five and twenty years ago, he had to rise
betimes to set off on a winter&rsquo;s-morning in order to be at Bradford
with the great waggon-load of goods manufactured by his father; this
load was packed over-night, but in the morning there was a great gathering
around it, and flashing of lanterns, and examination of horses&rsquo;
feet, before the ponderous waggon got under way; and then some one had
to go groping here and there, on hands and knees, and always sounding
with a staff down the long, steep, slippery brow, to find where the
horses might tread safely, until they reached the comparative easy-going
of the deep-rutted main road.&nbsp; People went on horseback over the
upland moors, following the tracks of the pack-horses that carried the
parcels, baggage, or goods from one town to another, between which there
did not happen to be a highway.</p>
<p>But in winter, all such communication was impossible, by reason of
the snow which lay long and late on the bleak high ground.&nbsp; I have
known people who, travelling by the mail-coach over Blackstone Edge,
had been snowed up for a week or ten days at the little inn near the
summit, and obliged to spend both Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Day
there, till the store of provisions laid in for the use of the landlord
and his family falling short before the inroads of the unexpected visitors,
they had recourse to the turkeys, geese, and Yorkshire pies with which
the coach was laden; and even these were beginning to fail, when a fortunate
thaw released them from their prison.</p>
<p>Isolated as the hill villages may be, they are in the world, compared
with the loneliness of the grey ancestral houses to be seen here and
there in the dense hollows of the moors.&nbsp; These dwellings are not
large, yet they are solid and roomy enough for the accommodation of
those who live in them, and to whom the surrounding estates belong.&nbsp;
The land has often been held by one family since the days of the Tudors;
the owners are, in fact, the remains of the old yeomanry&mdash;small
squires&mdash;who are rapidly becoming extinct as a class, from one
of two causes.&nbsp; Either the possessor falls into idle, drinking
habits, and so is obliged eventually to sell his property: or he finds,
if more shrewd and adventurous, that the &ldquo;beck&rdquo; running
down the mountain-side, or the minerals beneath his feet, can be turned
into a new source of wealth; and leaving the old plodding life of a
landowner with small capital, he turns manufacturer, or digs for coal,
or quarries for stone.</p>
<p>Still there are those remaining of this class&mdash;dwellers in the
lonely houses far away in the upland districts&mdash;even at the present
day, who sufficiently indicate what strange eccentricity&mdash;what
wild strength of will&mdash;nay, even what unnatural power of crime
was fostered by a mode of living in which a man seldom met his fellows,
and where public opinion was only a distant and inarticulate echo of
some clearer voice sounding behind the sweeping horizon.</p>
<p>A solitary life cherishes mere fancies until they become manias.&nbsp;
And the powerful Yorkshire character, which was scarcely tamed into
subjection by all the contact it met with in &ldquo;busy town or crowded
mart,&rdquo; has before now broken out into strange wilfulness in the
remoter districts.&nbsp; A singular account was recently given me of
a landowner (living, it is true, on the Lancashire side of the hills,
but of the same blood and nature as the dwellers on the other,) who
was supposed to be in the receipt of seven or eight hundred a year,
and whose house bore marks of handsome antiquity, as if his forefathers
had been for a long time people of consideration.&nbsp; My informant
was struck with the appearance of the place, and proposed to the countryman
who was accompanying him, to go up to it and take a nearer inspection.&nbsp;
The reply was, &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;d better not; he&rsquo;d threap yo&rsquo;
down th&rsquo; loan.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s let fly at some folk&rsquo;s legs,
and let shot lodge in &lsquo;em afore now, for going too near to his
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And finding, on closer inquiry, that such was really
the inhospitable custom of this moorland squire, the gentleman gave
up his purpose.&nbsp; I believe that the savage yeoman is still living.</p>
<p>Another squire, of more distinguished family and larger property&mdash;one
is thence led to imagine of better education, but that does not always
follow&mdash;died at his house, not many miles from Haworth, only a
few years ago.&nbsp; His great amusement and occupation had been cock-fighting.&nbsp;
When he was confined to his chamber with what he knew would be his last
illness, he had his cocks brought up there, and watched the bloody battle
from his bed.&nbsp; As his mortal disease increased, and it became impossible
for him to turn so as to follow the combat, he had looking-glasses arranged
in such a manner, around and above him, as he lay, that he could still
see the cocks fighting.&nbsp; And in this manner he died.</p>
<p>These are merely instances of eccentricity compared to the tales
of positive violence and crime that have occurred in these isolated
dwellings, which still linger in the memories of the old people of the
district, and some of which were doubtless familiar to the authors of
&ldquo;Wuthering Heights&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amusements of the lower classes could hardly be expected to be
more humane than those of the wealthy and better educated.&nbsp; The
gentleman, who has kindly furnished me with some of the particulars
I have given, remembers the bull-baitings at Rochdale, not thirty years
ago.&nbsp; The bull was fastened by a chain or rope to a post in the
river.&nbsp; To increase the amount of water, as well as to give their
workpeople the opportunity of savage delight, the masters were accustomed
to stop their mills on the day when the sport took place.&nbsp; The
bull would sometimes wheel suddenly round, so that the rope by which
he was fastened swept those who had been careless enough to come within
its range down into the water, and the good people of Rochdale had the
excitement of seeing one or two of their neighbours drowned, as well
as of witnessing the bull baited, and the dogs torn and tossed.</p>
<p>The people of Haworth were not less strong and full of character
than their neighbours on either side of the hills.&nbsp; The village
lies embedded in the moors, between the two counties, on the old road
between Keighley and Colne.&nbsp; About the middle of the last century,
it became famous in the religious world as the scene of the ministrations
of the Rev. William Grimshaw, curate of Haworth for twenty years.&nbsp;
Before this time, it is probable that the curates were of the same order
as one Mr. Nicholls, a Yorkshire clergyman, in the days immediately
succeeding the Reformation, who was &ldquo;much addicted to drinking
and company-keeping,&rdquo; and used to say to his companions, &ldquo;You
must not heed me but when I am got three feet above the earth,&rdquo;
that was, into the pulpit.</p>
<p>Mr. Grimshaw&rsquo;s life was written by Newton, Cowper&rsquo;s friend;
and from it may be gathered some curious particulars of the manner in
which a rough population were swayed and governed by a man of deep convictions,
and strong earnestness of purpose.&nbsp; It seems that he had not been
in any way remarkable for religious zeal, though he had led a moral
life, and been conscientious in fulfilling his parochial duties, until
a certain Sunday in September, 1744, when the servant, rising at five,
found her master already engaged in prayer; she stated that, after remaining
in his chamber for some time, he went to engage in religious exercises
in the house of a parishioner, then home again to pray; thence, still
fasting, to the church, where, as he was reading the second lesson,
he fell down, and, on his partial recovery, had to be led from the church.&nbsp;
As he went out, he spoke to the congregation, and told them not to disperse,
as he had something to say to them, and would return presently.&nbsp;
He was taken to the clerk&rsquo;s house, and again became insensible.&nbsp;
His servant rubbed him, to restore the circulation; and when he was
brought to himself &ldquo;he seemed in a great rapture,&rdquo; and the
first words he uttered were, &ldquo;I have had a glorious vision from
the third heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not say what he had seen, but
returned into the church, and began the service again, at two in the
afternoon, and went on until seven.</p>
<p>From this time he devoted himself, with the fervour of a Wesley,
and something of the fanaticism of a Whitfield, to calling out a religious
life among his parishioners.&nbsp; They had been in the habit of playing
at foot-ball on Sunday, using stones for this purpose; and giving and
receiving challenges from other parishes.&nbsp; There were horse-races
held on the moors just above the village, which were periodical sources
of drunkenness and profligacy.&nbsp; Scarcely a wedding took place without
the rough amusement of foot-races, where the half-naked runners were
a scandal to all decent strangers.&nbsp; The old custom of &ldquo;arvills,&rdquo;
or funeral feasts, led to frequent pitched battles between the drunken
mourners.&nbsp; Such customs were the outward signs of the kind of people
with whom Mr. Grimshaw had to deal.&nbsp; But, by various means, some
of the most practical kind, he wrought a great change in his parish.&nbsp;
In his preaching he was occasionally assisted by Wesley and Whitfield,
and at such times the little church proved much too small to hold the
throng that poured in from distant villages, or lonely moorland hamlets;
and frequently they were obliged to meet in the open air; indeed, there
was not room enough in the church even for the communicants.&nbsp; Mr.
Whitfield was once preaching in Haworth, and made use of some such expression,
as that he hoped there was no need to say much to this congregation,
as they had sat under so pious and godly a minister for so many years;
&ldquo;whereupon Mr. Grimshaw stood up in his place, and said with a
loud voice, &lsquo;Oh, sir! for God&rsquo;s sake do not speak so.&nbsp;
I pray you do not flatter them.&nbsp; I fear the greater part of them
are going to hell with their eyes open.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; But if they
were so bound, it was not for want of exertion on Mr. Grimshaw&rsquo;s
part to prevent them.&nbsp; He used to preach twenty or thirty times
a week in private houses.&nbsp; If he perceived any one inattentive
to his prayers, he would stop and rebuke the offender, and not go on
till he saw every one on their knees.&nbsp; He was very earnest in enforcing
the strict observance of Sunday; and would not even allow his parishioners
to walk in the fields between services.&nbsp; He sometimes gave out
a very long Psalm (tradition says the 119th), and while it was being
sung, he left the reading-desk, and taking a horsewhip went into the
public-houses, and flogged the loiterers into church.&nbsp; They were
swift who could escape the lash of the parson by sneaking out the back
way.&nbsp; He had strong health and an active body, and rode far and
wide over the hills, &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; those who had previously
had no sense of religion.&nbsp; To save time, and be no charge to the
families at whose houses he held his prayer-meetings, he carried his
provisions with him; all the food he took in the day on such occasions
consisting simply of a piece of bread and butter, or dry bread and a
raw onion.</p>
<p>The horse-races were justly objectionable to Mr. Grimshaw; they attracted
numbers of profligate people to Haworth, and brought a match to the
combustible materials of the place, only too ready to blaze out into
wickedness.&nbsp; The story is, that he tried all means of persuasion,
and even intimidation, to have the races discontinued, but in vain.&nbsp;
At length, in despair, he prayed with such fervour of earnestness that
the rain came down in torrents, and deluged the ground, so that there
was no footing for man or beast, even if the multitude had been willing
to stand such a flood let down from above.&nbsp; And so Haworth races
were stopped, and have never been resumed to this day.&nbsp; Even now
the memory of this good man is held in reverence, and his faithful ministrations
and real virtues are one of the boasts of the parish.</p>
<p>But after his time, I fear there was a falling back into the wild
rough heathen ways, from which he had pulled them up, as it were, by
the passionate force of his individual character.&nbsp; He had built
a chapel for the Wesleyan Methodists, and not very long after the Baptists
established themselves in a place of worship.&nbsp; Indeed, as Dr. Whitaker
says, the people of this district are &ldquo;strong religionists;&rdquo;
only, fifty years ago, their religion did not work down into their lives.&nbsp;
Half that length of time back, the code of morals seemed to be formed
upon that of their Norse ancestors.&nbsp; Revenge was handed down from
father to son as an hereditary duty; and a great capability for drinking
without the head being affected was considered as one of the manly virtues.&nbsp;
The games of foot-ball on Sundays, with the challenges to the neighbouring
parishes, were resumed, bringing in an influx of riotous strangers to
fill the public-houses, and make the more sober-minded inhabitants long
for good Mr. Grimshaw&rsquo;s stout arm, and ready horsewhip.&nbsp;
The old custom of &ldquo;arvills&rdquo; was as prevalent as ever.&nbsp;
The sexton, standing at the foot of the open grave, announced that the
&ldquo;arvill&rdquo; would be held at the Black Bull, or whatever public-house
might be fixed upon by the friends of the dead; and thither the mourners
and their acquaintances repaired.&nbsp; The origin of the custom had
been the necessity of furnishing some refreshment for those who came
from a distance, to pay the last mark of respect to a friend.&nbsp;
In the life of Oliver Heywood there are two quotations, which show what
sort of food was provided for &ldquo;arvills&rdquo; in quiet Nonconformist
connections in the seventeenth century; the first (from Thoresby) tells
of &ldquo;cold possets, stewed prunes, cake, and cheese,&rdquo; as being
the arvill after Oliver Heywood&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp; The second gives,
as rather shabby, according to the notion of the times (1673), &ldquo;nothing
but a bit of cake, draught of wine, piece of rosemary, and pair of gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the arvills at Haworth were often far more jovial doings.&nbsp;
Among the poor, the mourners were only expected to provide a kind of
spiced roll for each person; and the expense of the liquors&mdash;rum,
or ale, or a mixture of both called &ldquo;dog&rsquo;s nose&rdquo;&mdash;was
generally defrayed by each guest placing some money on a plate, set
in the middle of the table.&nbsp; Richer people would order a dinner
for their friends.&nbsp; At the funeral of Mr. Charnock (the next successor
but one to Mr. Grimshaw in the incumbency), above eighty people were
bid to the arvill, and the price of the feast was 4s. 6d. per head,
all of which was defrayed by the friends of the deceased.&nbsp; As few
&ldquo;shirked their liquor,&rdquo; there were very frequently &ldquo;up-and-down
fights&rdquo; before the close of the day; sometimes with the horrid
additions of &ldquo;pawsing&rdquo; and &ldquo;gouging,&rdquo; and biting.</p>
<p>Although I have dwelt on the exceptional traits in the characteristics
of these stalwart West-Ridingers, such as they were in the first quarter
of this century, if not a few years later, I have little doubt that
in the everyday life of the people so independent, wilful, and full
of grim humour, there would be much found even at present that would
shock those accustomed only to the local manners of the south; and,
in return, I suspect the shrewd, sagacious, energetic Yorkshireman would
hold such &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; in no small contempt.</p>
<p>I have said, it is most probable that where Haworth Church now stands,
there was once an ancient &ldquo;field-kirk,&rdquo; or oratory.&nbsp;
It occupied the third or lowest class of ecclesiastical structures,
according to the Saxon law, and had no right of sepulture, or administration
of sacraments.&nbsp; It was so called because it was built without enclosure,
and open to the adjoining fields or moors.&nbsp; The founder, according
to the laws of Edgar, was bound, without subtracting from his tithes,
to maintain the ministering priest out of the remaining nine parts of
his income.&nbsp; After the Reformation, the right of choosing their
clergyman, at any of those chapels of ease which had formerly been field-kirks,
was vested in the freeholders and trustees, subject to the approval
of the vicar of the parish.&nbsp; But owing to some negligence, this
right has been lost to the freeholders and trustees at Haworth, ever
since the days of Archbishop Sharp; and the power of choosing a minister
has lapsed into the hands of the Vicar of Bradford.&nbsp; So runs the
account, according to one authority.</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; says,&mdash;&ldquo;This living has for its patrons
the Vicar of Bradford and certain trustees.&nbsp; My predecessor took
the living with the consent of the Vicar of Bradford, but in opposition
to the trustees; in consequence of which he was so opposed that, after
only three weeks&rsquo; possession, he was compelled to resign.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A Yorkshire gentleman, who has kindly sent me some additional information
on this subject since the second edition of my work was published, write,
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The sole right of presentation to the incumbency
of Haworth is vested in the Vicar of Bradford.&nbsp; He only can present.&nbsp;
The funds, however, from which the clergyman&rsquo;s stipend mainly
proceeds, are vested in the hands of trustees, who have the power to
withhold them, if a nominee is sent of whom they disapprove.&nbsp; On
the decease of Mr. Charnock, the Vicar first tendered the preferment
to Mr. Bront&euml;, and he went over to his expected cure.&nbsp; He
was told that towards himself they had no personal objection; but as
a nominee of the Vicar he would not be received.&nbsp; He therefore
retired, with the declaration that if he could not come with the approval
of the parish, his ministry could not be useful.&nbsp; Upon this the
attempt was made to introduce Mr. Redhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Mr. Redhead was repelled, a fresh difficulty arose.&nbsp;
Some one must first move towards a settlement, but a spirit being evoked
which could not be allayed, action became perplexing.&nbsp; The matter
had to be referred to some independent arbitrator, and my father was
the gentleman to whom each party turned its eye.&nbsp; A meeting was
convened, and the business settled by the Vicar&rsquo;s conceding the
choice to the trustees, and the acceptance of the Vicar&rsquo;s presentation.&nbsp;
That choice forthwith fell on Mr. Bront&euml;, whose promptness and
prudence had won their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conversing on the character of the inhabitants of the West Riding
with Dr. Scoresby, who had been for some time Vicar of Bradford, he
alluded to certain riotous transactions which had taken place at Haworth
on the presentation of the living to Mr. Redhead, and said that there
had been so much in the particulars indicative of the character of the
people, that he advised me to inquire into them.&nbsp; I have accordingly
done so, and, from the lips of some of the survivors among the actors
and spectators, I have learnt the means taken to eject the nominee of
the Vicar.</p>
<p>The previous incumbent had been the Mr. Charnock whom I have mentioned
as next but one in succession to Mr. Grimshaw.&nbsp; He had a long illness
which rendered him unable to discharge his duties without assistance,
and Mr. Redhead gave him occasional help, to the great satisfaction
of the parishioners, and was highly respected by them during Mr. Charnock&rsquo;s
lifetime.&nbsp; But the case was entirely altered when, at Mr. Charnock&rsquo;s
death in 1819, they conceived that the trustees had been unjustly deprived
of their rights by the Vicar of Bradford, who appointed Mr. Redhead
as perpetual curate.</p>
<p>The first Sunday he officiated, Haworth Church was filled even to
the aisles; most of the people wearing the wooden clogs of the district.&nbsp;
But while Mr. Redhead was reading the second lesson, the whole congregation,
as by one impulse, began to leave the church, making all the noise they
could with clattering and clumping of clogs, till, at length, Mr. Redhead
and the clerk were the only two left to continue the service.&nbsp;
This was bad enough, but the next Sunday the proceedings were far worse.&nbsp;
Then, as before, the church was well filled, but the aisles were left
clear; not a creature, not an obstacle was in the way.&nbsp; The reason
for this was made evident about the same time in the reading of the
service as the disturbances had begun the previous week.&nbsp; A man
rode into the church upon an ass, with his face turned towards the tail,
and as many old hats piled on his head as he could possibly carry.&nbsp;
He began urging his beast round the aisles, and the screams, and cries,
and laughter of the congregation entirely drowned all sound of Mr. Redhead&rsquo;s
voice, and, I believe, he was obliged to desist.</p>
<p>Hitherto they had not proceeded to anything like personal violence;
but on the third Sunday they must have been greatly irritated at seeing
Mr. Redhead, determined to brave their will, ride up the village street,
accompanied by several gentlemen from Bradford.&nbsp; They put up their
horses at the Black Bull&mdash;the little inn close upon the churchyard,
for the convenience of arvills as well as for other purposes&mdash;and
went into church.&nbsp; On this the people followed, with a chimney-sweeper,
whom they had employed to clean the chimneys of some out-buildings belonging
to the church that very morning, and afterward plied with drink till
he was in a state of solemn intoxication.&nbsp; They placed him right
before the reading-desk, where his blackened face nodded a drunken,
stupid assent to all that Mr. Redhead said.&nbsp; At last, either prompted
by some mischief-maker, or from some tipsy impulse, he clambered up
the pulpit stairs, and attempted to embrace Mr. Redhead.&nbsp; Then
the profane fun grew fast and furious.&nbsp; Some of the more riotous,
pushed the soot-covered chimney-sweeper against Mr. Redhead, as he tried
to escape.&nbsp; They threw both him and his tormentor down on the ground
in the churchyard where the soot-bag had been emptied, and, though,
at last, Mr. Redhead escaped into the Black Bull, the doors of which
were immediately barred, the people raged without, threatening to stone
him and his friends.&nbsp; One of my informants is an old man, who was
the landlord of the inn at the time, and he stands to it that such was
the temper of the irritated mob, that Mr. Redhead was in real danger
of his life.&nbsp; This man, however, planned an escape for his unpopular
inmates.&nbsp; The Black Bull is near the top of the long, steep Haworth
street, and at the bottom, close by the bridge, on the road to Keighley,
is a turnpike.&nbsp; Giving directions to his hunted guests to steal
out at the back door (through which, probably, many a ne&rsquo;er-do-weel
has escaped from good Mr. Grimshaw&rsquo;s horsewhip), the landlord
and some of the stable-boys rode the horses belonging to the party from
Bradford backwards and forwards before his front door, among the fiercely-expectant
crowd.&nbsp; Through some opening between the houses, those on the horses
saw Mr. Redhead and his friends creeping along behind the street; and
then, striking spurs, they dashed quickly down to the turnpike; the
obnoxious clergyman and his friends mounted in haste, and had sped some
distance before the people found out that their prey had escaped, and
came running to the closed turnpike gate.</p>
<p>This was Mr. Redhead&rsquo;s last appearance at Haworth for many
years.&nbsp; Long afterwards, he came to preach, and in his sermon to
a large and attentive congregation he good-humouredly reminded them
of the circumstances which I have described.&nbsp; They gave him a hearty
welcome, for they owed him no grudge; although before they had been
ready enough to stone him, in order to maintain what they considered
to be their rights.</p>
<p>The foregoing account, which I heard from two of the survivors, in
the presence of a friend who can vouch for the accuracy of my repetition,
has to a certain degree been confirmed by a letter from the Yorkshire
gentleman, whose words I have already quoted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised at your difficulty in authenticating matter-of-fact.&nbsp;
I find this in recalling what I have heard, and the authority on which
I have heard anything.&nbsp; As to the donkey tale, I believe you are
right.&nbsp; Mr. Redhead and Dr. Ramsbotham, his son-in-law, are no
strangers to me.&nbsp; Each of them has a niche in my affections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked, this day, two persons who lived in Haworth at
the time to which you allude, the son and daughter of an acting trustee,
and each of them between sixty and seventy years of age, and they assure
me that the donkey was introduced.&nbsp; One of them says it was mounted
by a half-witted man, seated with his face towards the tail of the beast,
and having several hats piled on his head.&nbsp; Neither of my informants
was, however, present at these edifying services.&nbsp; I believe that
no movement was made in the church on either Sunday, until the whole
of the authorised reading-service was gone through, and I am sure that
nothing was more remote from the more respectable party than any personal
antagonism toward Mr. Redhead.&nbsp; He was one of the most amiable
and worthy of men, a man to myself endeared by many ties and obligations.&nbsp;
I never heard before your book that the sweep ascended the pulpit steps.&nbsp;
He was present, however, in the clerical habiliments of his order .
. . I may also add that among the many who were present at those sad
Sunday orgies the majority were non-residents, and came from those moorland
fastnesses on the outskirts of the parish locally designated as &lsquo;ovver
th&rsquo; steyres,&rsquo; one stage more remote than Haworth from modern
civilization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To an instance or two more of the rusticity of the inhabitants
of the chapelry of Haworth, I may introduce you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Haworth carrier called at the office of a friend of mine
to deliver a parcel on a cold winter&rsquo;s day, and stood with the
door open.&nbsp; &lsquo;Robin! shut the door!&rsquo; said the recipient.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you no doors in your country?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yoi,&rsquo;
responded Robin, &lsquo;we hev, but we nivver steik &lsquo;em.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I have frequently remarked the number of doors open even in winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When well directed, the indomitable and independent energies
of the natives of this part of the country are invaluable; dangerous
when perverted.&nbsp; I shall never forget the fierce actions and utterances
of one suffering from delirium tremens.&nbsp; Whether in its wrath,
disdain, or its dismay, the countenance was infernal.&nbsp; I called
once upon a time on a most respectable yeoman, and I was, in language
earnest and homely, pressed to accept the hospitality of the house.&nbsp;
I consented.&nbsp; The word to me was, &lsquo;Nah, Maister, yah mun
stop an hev sum te-ah, yah mun, eah, yah mun.&rsquo;&nbsp; A bountiful
table was soon spread; at all events, time soon went while I scaled
the hills to see &lsquo;t&rsquo; maire at wor thretty year owd, an&rsquo;t&rsquo;
feil at wor fewer.&rsquo;&nbsp; On sitting down to the table, a venerable
woman officiated, and after filling the cups, she thus addressed me:
&lsquo;Nah, Maister, yah mun loawze th&rsquo;taible&rsquo; (loose the
table).&nbsp; The master said, &lsquo;Shah meeans yah mun sey t&rsquo;
greyce.&rsquo;&nbsp; I took the hint, and uttered the blessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke with an aged and tried woman at one time, who, after
recording her mercies, stated, among others, her powers of speech, by
asserting &lsquo;Thank the Lord, ah nivver wor a meilly-meouthed wumman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I feel particularly at fault in attempting the orthography of the dialect,
but must excuse myself by telling you that I once saw a letter in which
the word I have just now used (excuse) was written &lsquo;ecksqueaize!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some things, however, which rather tend to soften
the idea of the rudeness of Haworth.&nbsp; No rural district has been
more markedly the abode of musical taste and acquirement, and this at
a period when it was difficult to find them to the same extent apart
from towns in advance of their times.&nbsp; I have gone to Haworth and
found an orchestra to meet me, filled with local performers, vocal and
instrumental, to whom the best works of Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Marcello,
&amp;c. &amp;c., were familiar as household words.&nbsp; By knowledge,
taste, and voice, they were markedly separate from ordinary village
choirs, and have been put in extensive requisition for the solo and
chorus of many an imposing festival.&nbsp; One man still survives, who,
for fifty years, has had one of the finest tenor voices I ever heard,
and with it a refined and cultivated taste.&nbsp; To him and to others
many inducements have been offered to migrate; but the loom, the association,
the mountain air have had charms enow to secure their continuance at
home.&nbsp; I love the recollection of their performance; that recollection
extends over more than sixty years.&nbsp; The attachments, the antipathies
and the hospitalities of the district are ardent, hearty, and homely.&nbsp;
Cordiality in each is the prominent characteristic.&nbsp; As a people,
these mountaineers have ever been accessible to gentleness and truth,
so far as I have known them; but excite suspicion or resentment, and
they give emphatic and not impotent resistance.&nbsp; Compulsion they
defy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accompanied Mr. Heap on his first visit to Haworth after
his accession to the vicarage of Bradford.&nbsp; It was on Easter day,
either 1816 or 1817.&nbsp; His predecessor, the venerable John Crosse,
known as the &lsquo;blind vicar,&rsquo; had been inattentive to the
vicarial claims.&nbsp; A searching investigation had to be made and
enforced, and as it proceeded stout and sturdy utterances were not lacking
on the part of the parishioners.&nbsp; To a spectator, though rude,
they were amusing, and significant, foretelling what might be expected,
and what was afterwards realised, on the advent of a new incumbent,
if they deemed him an intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From their peculiar parochial position and circumstances,
the inhabitants of the chapelry have been prompt, earnest, and persevering
in their opposition to church-rates.&nbsp; Although ten miles from the
mother-church, they were called upon to defray a large proportion of
this obnoxious tax,&mdash;I believe one fifth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides this, they had to maintain their own edifice, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&nbsp; They resisted, therefore, with energy, that which they
deemed to be oppression and injustice.&nbsp; By scores would they wend
their way from the hills to attend a vestry meeting at Bradford, and
in such service failed not to show less of the <i>suaviter in modo</i>
than the <i>fortiter in re</i>.&nbsp; Happily such occasion for their
action has not occurred for many years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of patronymics has been common in this locality.&nbsp;
Inquire for a man by his Christian name and surname, and you may have
some difficulty in finding him: ask, however, for &lsquo;George o&rsquo;
Ned&rsquo;s,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Dick o&rsquo; Bob&rsquo;s,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Tom
o&rsquo; Jack&rsquo;s,&rsquo; as the case may be, and your difficulty
is at an end.&nbsp; In many instances the person is designated by his
residence.&nbsp; In my early years I had occasion to inquire for Jonathan
Whitaker, who owned a considerable farm in the township.&nbsp; I was
sent hither and thither, until it occurred to me to ask for &lsquo;Jonathan
o&rsquo; th&rsquo; Gate.&rsquo;&nbsp; My difficulties were then at an
end.&nbsp; Such circumstances arise out of the settled character and
isolation of the natives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who have witnessed a Haworth wedding when the parties
were above the rank of labourers, will not easily forget the scene.&nbsp;
A levy was made on the horses of the neighbourhood, and a merry cavalcade
of mounted men and women, single or double, traversed the way to Bradford
church.&nbsp; The inn and church appeared to be in natural connection,
and as the labours of the Temperance Society had then to begin, the
interests of sobriety were not always consulted.&nbsp; On remounting
their steeds they commenced with a race, and not unfrequently an inebriate
or unskilful horseman or woman was put <i>hors de combat</i>.&nbsp;
A race also was frequent at the end. of these wedding expeditions, from
the bridge to the toll-bar at Haworth.&nbsp; The race-course you will
know to be anything but level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the midst of this lawless, yet not unkindly population, Mr.
Bront&euml; brought his wife and six little children, in February, 1820.&nbsp;
There are those yet alive who remember seven heavily-laden carts lumbering
slowly up the long stone street, bearing the &ldquo;new parson&rsquo;s&rdquo;
household goods to his future abode.</p>
<p>One wonders how the bleak aspect of her new home&mdash;the low, oblong,
stone parsonage, high up, yet with a still higher back-ground of sweeping
moors&mdash;struck on the gentle, delicate wife, whose health even then
was failing.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>The Rev. Patrick Bront&euml; is a native of the County Down in Ireland.&nbsp;
His father Hugh Bront&euml;, was left an orphan at an early age.&nbsp;
He came from the south to the north of the island, and settled in the
parish of Ahaderg, near Loughbrickland.&nbsp; There was some family
tradition that, humble as Hugh Bront&euml;&rsquo;s circumstances were,
he was the descendant of an ancient family.&nbsp; But about this neither
he nor his descendants have cared to inquire.&nbsp; He made an early
marriage, and reared and educated ten children on the proceeds of the
few acres of land which he farmed.&nbsp; This large family were remarkable
for great physical strength, and much personal beauty.&nbsp; Even in
his old age, Mr. Bront&euml; is a striking-looking man, above the common
height, with a nobly-shaped head, and erect carriage.&nbsp; In his youth
he must have been unusually handsome.</p>
<p>He was born on Patrickmas day (March 17), 1777, and early gave tokens
of extraordinary quickness and intelligence.&nbsp; He had also his full
share of ambition; and of his strong sense and forethought there is
a proof in the fact, that, knowing that his father could afford him
no pecuniary aid, and that he must depend upon his own exertions, he
opened a public school at the early age of sixteen; and this mode of
living he continued to follow for five or six years.&nbsp; He then became
a tutor in the family of the Rev. Mr. Tighe, rector of Drumgooland parish.&nbsp;
Thence he proceeded to St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where he
was entered in July, 1802, being at the time five-and-twenty years of
age.&nbsp; After nearly four years&rsquo; residence, he obtained his
B.A. degree, and was ordained to a curacy in Essex, whence he removed
into Yorkshire.&nbsp; The course of life of which this is the outline,
shows a powerful and remarkable character, originating and pursuing
a purpose in a resolute and independent manner.&nbsp; Here is a youth&mdash;a
boy of sixteen&mdash;separating himself from his family, and determining
to maintain himself; and that, not in the hereditary manner by agricultural
pursuits, but by the labour of his brain.</p>
<p>I suppose, from what I have heard, that Mr. Tighe became strongly
interested in his children&rsquo;s tutor, and may have aided him, not
only in the direction of his studies, but in the suggestion of an English
university education, and in advice as to the mode in which he should
obtain entrance there.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; has now no trace of his
Irish origin remaining in his speech; he never could have shown his
Celtic descent in the straight Greek lines and long oval of his face;
but at five-and-twenty, fresh from the only life he had ever known,
to present himself at the gates of St. John&rsquo;s proved no little
determination of will, and scorn of ridicule.</p>
<p>While at Cambridge, he became one of a corps of volunteers, who were
then being called out all over the country to resist the apprehended
invasion by the French.&nbsp; I have heard him allude, in late years,
to Lord Palmerston as one who had often been associated with him then
in the mimic military duties which they had to perform.</p>
<p>We take him up now settled as a curate at Hartshead, in Yorkshire&mdash;far
removed from his birth-place and all his Irish connections; with whom,
indeed, he cared little to keep up any intercourse, and whom he never,
I believe, revisited after becoming a student at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Hartshead is a very small village, lying to the east of Huddersfield
and Halifax; and, from its high situation&mdash;on a mound, as it were,
surrounded by a circular basin&mdash;commanding a magnificent view.&nbsp;
Mr. Bront&euml; resided here for five years; and, while the incumbent
of Hartshead, he wooed and married Maria Branwell.</p>
<p>She was the third daughter of Mr. Thomas Branwell, merchant, of Penzance.&nbsp;
Her mother&rsquo;s maiden name was Carne: and, both on father&rsquo;s
and mother&rsquo;s side, the Branwell family were sufficiently well
descended to enable them to mix in the best society that Penzance then
afforded.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Branwell would be living&mdash;their family
of four daughters and one son, still children&mdash;during the existence
of that primitive state of society which is well described by Dr. Davy
in the life of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same town, when the population was about 2,000 persons,
there was only one carpet, the floors of rooms were sprinkled with sea-sand,
and there was not a single silver fork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time, when our colonial possessions were very limited,
our army and navy on a small scale, and there was comparatively little
demand for intellect, the younger sons of gentlemen were often of necessity
brought up to some trade or mechanical art, to which no discredit, or
loss of caste, as it were, was attached.&nbsp; The eldest son, if not
allowed to remain an idle country squire, was sent to Oxford or Cambridge,
preparatory to his engaging in one of the three liberal professions
of divinity, law, or physic; the second son was perhaps apprenticed
to a surgeon or apothecary, or a solicitor; the third to a pewterer
or watchmaker; the fourth to a packer or mercer, and so on, were there
more to be provided for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After their apprenticeships were finished, the young men almost
invariably went to London to perfect themselves in their respective
trade or art: and on their return into the country, when settled in
business, they were not excluded from what would now be considered genteel
society.&nbsp; Visiting then was conducted differently from what it
is at present.&nbsp; Dinner-parties were almost unknown, excepting at
the annual feast-time.&nbsp; Christmas, too, was then a season of peculiar
indulgence and conviviality, and a round of entertainments was given,
consisting of tea and supper.&nbsp; Excepting at these two periods,
visiting was almost entirely confined to tea-parties, which assembled
at three o&rsquo;clock, broke up at nine, and the amusement of the evening
was commonly some round game at cards, as Pope Joan, or Commerce.&nbsp;
The lower class was then extremely ignorant, and all classes were very
superstitious; even the belief in witches maintained its ground, and
there was an almost unbounded credulity respecting the supernatural
and monstrous.&nbsp; There was scarcely a parish in the Mount&rsquo;s
Bay that was without a haunted house, or a spot to which some story
of supernatural horror was not attached.&nbsp; Even when I was a boy,
I remember a house in the best street of Penzance which was uninhabited
because it was believed to be haunted, and which young people walked
by at night at a quickened pace, and with a beating heart.&nbsp; Amongst
the middle and higher classes there was little taste for literature,
and still less for science, and their pursuits were rarely of a dignified
or intellectual kind.&nbsp; Hunting, shooting, wrestling, cock-fighting,
generally ending in drunkenness, were what they most delighted in.&nbsp;
Smuggling was carried on to a great extent; and drunkenness, and a low
state of morals, were naturally associated with it.&nbsp; Whilst smuggling
was the means of acquiring wealth to bold and reckless adventurers,
drunkenness and dissipation occasioned the ruin of many respectable
families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have given this extract because I conceive it bears some reference
to the life of Miss Bront&euml;, whose strong mind and vivid imagination
must have received their first impressions either from the servants
(in that simple household, almost friendly companions during the greater
part of the day,) retailing the traditions or the news of Haworth village;
or from Mr. Bront&euml;, whose intercourse with his children appears
to have been considerably restrained, and whose life, both in Ireland
and at Cambridge, had been spent under peculiar circumstances; or from
her aunt, Miss Branwell, who came to the parsonage, when Charlotte was
only six or seven years old, to take charge of her dead sister&rsquo;s
family.&nbsp; This aunt was older than Mrs. Bront&euml;, and had lived
longer among the Penzance society, which Dr. Davy describes.&nbsp; But
in the Branwell family itself, the violence and irregularity of nature
did not exist.&nbsp; They were Methodists, and, as far as I can gather,
a gentle and sincere piety gave refinement and purity of character.&nbsp;
Mr. Branwell, the father, according to his descendants&rsquo; account,
was a man of musical talent.&nbsp; He and his wife lived to see all
their children grown up, and died within a year of each other&mdash;he
in 1808, she in 1809, when their daughter Maria was twenty-five or twenty-six
years of age.&nbsp; I have been permitted to look over a series of nine
letters, which were addressed by her to Mr. Bront&euml;, during the
brief term of their engagement in 1812.&nbsp; They are full of tender
grace of expression and feminine modesty; pervaded by the deep piety
to which I have alluded as a family characteristic.&nbsp; I shall make
one or two extracts from them, to show what sort of a person was the
mother of Charlotte Bront&euml;: but first, I must state the circumstances
under which this Cornish lady met the scholar from Ahaderg, near Loughbrickland.&nbsp;
In the early summer of 1812, when she would be twenty-nine, she came
to visit her uncle, the Reverend John Fennel, who was at that time a
clergyman of the Church of England, living near Leeds, but who had previously
been a Methodist minister.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; was the incumbent of
Hartshead; and had the reputation in the neighbourhood of being a very
handsome fellow, full of Irish enthusiasm, and with something of an
Irishman&rsquo;s capability of falling easily in love.&nbsp; Miss Branwell
was extremely small in person; not pretty, but very elegant, and always
dressed with a quiet simplicity of taste, which accorded well with her
general character, and of which some of the details call to mind the
style of dress preferred by her daughter for her favourite heroines.&nbsp;
Mr. Bront&euml; was soon captivated by the little, gentle creature,
and this time declared that it was for life.&nbsp; In her first letter
to him, dated August 26th, she seems almost surprised to find herself
engaged, and alludes to the short time which she has known him.&nbsp;
In the rest there are touches reminding one of Juliet&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But trust me, gentleman, I&rsquo;ll prove more
true,<br />
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are plans for happy pic-nic parties to Kirkstall Abbey, in
the glowing September days, when &ldquo;Uncle, Aunt, and Cousin Jane,&rdquo;&mdash;the
last engaged to a Mr. Morgan, another clergyman&mdash;were of the party;
all since dead, except Mr. Bront&euml;.&nbsp; There was no opposition
on the part of any of her friends to her engagement.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs.
Fennel sanctioned it, and her brother and sisters in far-away Penzance
appear fully to have approved of it.&nbsp; In a letter dated September
18th, she says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some years I have been perfectly my own mistress, subject
to no control whatever; so far from it, that my sisters, who are many
years older than myself, and even my dear mother, used to consult me
on every occasion of importance, and scarcely ever doubted the propriety
of my opinions and actions: perhaps you will be ready to accuse me of
vanity in mentioning this, but you must consider that I do not boast
of it.&nbsp; I have many times felt it a disadvantage, and although,
I thank God, it has never led me into error, yet, in circumstances of
uncertainty and doubt, I have deeply felt the want of a guide and instructor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the same letter she tells Mr. Bront&euml;, that she has informed
her sisters of her engagement, and that she should not see them again
so soon as she had intended.&nbsp; Mr. Fennel, her uncle, also writes
to them by the same post in praise of Mr. Bront&euml;.</p>
<p>The journey from Penzance to Leeds in those days was both very long
and very expensive; the lovers had not much money to spend in unnecessary
travelling, and, as Miss Branwell had neither father nor mother living,
it appeared both a discreet and seemly arrangement that the marriage
should take place from her uncle&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; There was no reason
either why the engagement should be prolonged.&nbsp; They were past
their first youth; they had means sufficient for their unambitious wants;
the living of Hartshead is rated in the Clergy List at 202<i>l</i>.
per annum, and she was in the receipt of a small annuity (50<i>l</i>.
I have been told) by the will of her father.&nbsp; So, at the end of
September, the lovers began to talk about taking a house, for I suppose
that Mr. Bront&euml; up to that time had been in lodgings; and all went
smoothly and successfully with a view to their marriage in the ensuing
winter, until November, when a misfortune happened, which she thus patiently
and prettily describes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you never expected to be much the richer for me,
but I am sorry to inform you that I am still poorer than I thought myself.&nbsp;
I mentioned having sent for my books, clothes, &amp;c.&nbsp; On Saturday
evening, about the time when you were writing the description of your
imaginary shipwreck, I was reading and feeling the effects of a real
one, having then received a letter from my sister giving me an account
of the vessel in which she had sent my box being stranded on the coast
of Devonshire, in consequence of which the box was dashed to pieces
with the violence of the sea, and all my little property, with the exception
of a very few articles, being swallowed up in the mighty deep.&nbsp;
If this should not prove the prelude to something worse I shall think
little of it, as it is the first disastrous circumstance which has occurred
since I left my home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last of these letters is dated December the 5th.&nbsp; Miss Branwell
and her cousin intended to set about making the wedding-cake in the
following week, so the marriage could not be far off.&nbsp; She had
been learning by heart a &ldquo;pretty little hymn&rdquo; of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
composing; and reading Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Advice to a Lady,&rdquo;
on which she makes some pertinent and just remarks, showing that she
thought as well as read.&nbsp; And so Maria Branwell fades out of sight;
we have no more direct intercourse with her; we hear of her as Mrs.
Bront&euml;, but it is as an invalid, not far from death; still patient,
cheerful, and pious.&nbsp; The writing of these letters is elegant and
neat; while there are allusions to household occupations&mdash;such
as making the wedding-cake; there are also allusions to the books she
has read, or is reading, showing a well-cultivated mind.&nbsp; Without
having anything of her daughter&rsquo;s rare talents, Mrs. Bront&euml;
must have been, I imagine, that unusual character, a well-balanced and
consistent woman.&nbsp; The style of the letters is easy and good; as
is also that of a paper from the same hand, entitled &ldquo;The Advantages
of Poverty in Religious Concerns,&rdquo; which was written rather later,
with a view to publication in some periodical.</p>
<p>She was married from her uncle&rsquo;s house in Yorkshire, on the
29th of December, 1812; the same day was also the wedding-day of her
younger sister, Charlotte Branwell, in distant Penzance.&nbsp; I do
not think that Mrs. Bront&euml; ever revisited Cornwall, but she has
left a very pleasant impression on the minds of those relations who
yet survive; they speak of her as &ldquo;their favourite aunt, and one
to whom they, as well as all the family, looked up, as a person of talent
and great amiability of disposition;&rdquo; and, again, as &ldquo;meek
and retiring, while possessing more than ordinary talents, which she
inherited from her father, and her piety was genuine and unobtrusive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; remained for five years at Hartshead, in the parish
of Dewsbury.&nbsp; There he was married, and his two children, Maria
and Elizabeth, were born.&nbsp; At the expiration of that period, he
had the living of Thornton, in Bradford Parish.&nbsp; Some of those
great West Riding parishes are almost like bishoprics for their amount
of population and number of churches.&nbsp; Thornton church is a little
episcopal chapel of ease, rich in Nonconformist monuments, as of Accepted
Lister and his friend Dr. Hall.&nbsp; The neighbourhood is desolate
and wild; great tracts of bleak land, enclosed by stone dykes, sweeping
up Clayton heights.&nbsp; The church itself looks ancient and solitary,
and as if left behind by the great stone mills of a flourishing Independent
firm, and the solid square chapel built by the members of that denomination.&nbsp;
Altogether not so pleasant a place as Hartshead, with its ample outlook
over cloud-shadowed, sun-flecked plain, and hill rising beyond hill
to form the distant horizon.</p>
<p>Here, at Thornton, Charlotte Bront&euml; was born, on the 21st of
April, 1816.&nbsp; Fast on her heels followed Patrick Branwell, Emily
Jane, and Anne.&nbsp; After the birth of this last daughter, Mrs. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
health began to decline.&nbsp; It is hard work to provide for the little
tender wants of many young children where the means are but limited.&nbsp;
The necessaries of food and clothing are much more easily supplied than
the almost equal necessaries of attendance, care, soothing, amusement,
and sympathy.&nbsp; Maria Bront&euml;, the eldest of six, could only
have been a few months more than six years old, when Mr. Bront&euml;
removed to Haworth, on February the 25th, 1820.&nbsp; Those who knew
her then, describe her as grave, thoughtful, and quiet, to a degree
far beyond her years.&nbsp; Her childhood was no childhood; the cases
are rare in which the possessors of great gifts have known the blessings
of that careless happy time; <i>their</i> unusual powers stir within
them, and, instead of the natural life of perception&mdash;the objective,
as the Germans call it&mdash;they begin the deeper life of reflection&mdash;the
subjective.</p>
<p>Little Maria Bront&euml; was delicate and small in appearance, which
seemed to give greater effect to her wonderful precocity of intellect.&nbsp;
She must have been her mother&rsquo;s companion and helpmate in many
a household and nursery experience, for Mr. Bront&euml; was, of course,
much engaged in his study; and besides, he was not naturally fond of
children, and felt their frequent appearance on the scene as a drag
both on his wife&rsquo;s strength, and as an interruption to the comfort
of the household.</p>
<p>Haworth Parsonage is&mdash;as I mentioned in the first chapter&mdash;an
oblong stone house, facing down the hill on which the village stands,
and with the front door right opposite to the western door of the church,
distant about a hundred yards.&nbsp; Of this space twenty yards or so
in depth are occupied by the grassy garden, which is scarcely wider
than the house.&nbsp; The graveyard lies on two sides of the house and
garden.&nbsp; The house consists of four rooms on each floor, and is
two stories high.&nbsp; When the Bront&euml;s took possession, they
made the larger parlour, to the left of the entrance, the family sitting-room,
while that on the right was appropriated to Mr. Bront&euml; as a study.&nbsp;
Behind this was the kitchen; behind the former, a sort of flagged store-room.&nbsp;
Upstairs were four bed-chambers of similar size, with the addition of
a small apartment over the passage, or &ldquo;lobby&rdquo; as we call
it in the north.&nbsp; This was to the front, the staircase going up
right opposite to the entrance.&nbsp; There is the pleasant old fashion
of window seats all through the house; and one can see that the parsonage
was built in the days when wood was plentiful, as the massive stair-banisters,
and the wainscots, and the heavy window-frames testify.</p>
<p>This little extra upstairs room was appropriated to the children.&nbsp;
Small as it was, it was not called a nursery; indeed, it had not the
comfort of a fire-place in it; the servants&mdash;two affectionate,
warm-hearted sisters, who cannot now speak of the family without tears&mdash;called
the room the &ldquo;children&rsquo;s study.&rdquo;&nbsp; The age of
the eldest student was perhaps by this time seven.</p>
<p>The people in Haworth were none of them very poor.&nbsp; Many of
them were employed in the neighbouring worsted mills; a few were mill-owners
and manufacturers in a small way; there were also some shopkeepers for
the humbler and everyday wants; but for medical advice, for stationery,
books, law, dress, or dainties, the inhabitants had to go to Keighley.&nbsp;
There were several Sunday-schools; the Baptists had taken the lead in
instituting them, the Wesleyans had followed, the Church of England
had brought up the rear.&nbsp; Good Mr. Grimshaw, Wesley&rsquo;s friend,
had built a humble Methodist chapel, but it stood close to the road
leading on to the moor; the Baptists then raised a place of worship,
with the distinction of being a few yards back from the highway; and
the Methodists have since thought it well to erect another and a larger
chapel, still more retired from the road.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; was
ever on kind and friendly terms with each denomination as a body; but
from individuals in the village the family stood aloof, unless some
direct service was required, from the first.&nbsp; &ldquo;They kept
themselves very close,&rdquo; is the account given by those who remember
Mr. and Mrs. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s coming amongst them.&nbsp; I believe
many of the Yorkshiremen would object to the system of parochial visiting;
their surly independence would revolt from the idea of any one having
a right, from his office, to inquire into their condition, to counsel,
or to admonish them.&nbsp; The old hill-spirit lingers in them, which
coined the rhyme, inscribed on the under part of one of the seats in
the Sedilia of Whalley Abbey, not many miles from Haworth,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who mells wi&rsquo; what another does<br />
Had best go home and shoe his goose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked an inhabitant of a district close to Haworth what sort of
a clergyman they had at the church which he attended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rare good one,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;he minds his own business,
and ne&rsquo;er troubles himself with ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; was faithful in visiting the sick and all those who
sent for him, and diligent in attendance at the schools; and so was
his daughter Charlotte too; but, cherishing and valuing privacy themselves,
they were perhaps over-delicate in not intruding upon the privacy of
others.</p>
<p>From their first going to Haworth, their walks were directed rather
out towards the heathery moors, sloping upwards behind the parsonage,
than towards the long descending village street.&nbsp; A good old woman,
who came to nurse Mrs. Bront&euml; in the illness&mdash;an internal
cancer&mdash;which grew and gathered upon her, not many months after
her arrival at Haworth, tells me that at that time the six little creatures
used to walk out, hand in hand, towards the glorious wild moors, which
in after days they loved so passionately; the elder ones taking thoughtful
care for the toddling wee things.</p>
<p>They were grave and silent beyond their years; subdued, probably,
by the presence of serious illness in the house; for, at the time which
my informant speaks of, Mrs. Bront&euml; was confined to the bedroom
from which she never came forth alive.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not have
known there was a child in the house, they were such still, noiseless,
good little creatures.&nbsp; Maria would shut herself up&rdquo; (Maria,
but seven!) &ldquo;in the children&rsquo;s study with a newspaper, and
be able to tell one everything when she came out; debates in Parliament,
and I don&rsquo;t know what all.&nbsp; She was as good as a mother to
her sisters and brother.&nbsp; But there never were such good children.&nbsp;
I used to think them spiritless, they were so different to any children
I had ever seen.&nbsp; They were good little creatures.&nbsp; Emily
was the prettiest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bront&euml; was the same patient, cheerful person as we have
seen her formerly; very ill, suffering great pain, but seldom if ever
complaining; at her better times begging her nurse to raise her in bed
to let her see her clean the grate, &ldquo;because she did it as it
was done in Cornwall;&rdquo; devotedly fond of her husband, who warmly
repaid her affection, and suffered no one else to take the night-nursing;
but, according to my informant, the mother was not very anxious to see
much of her children, probably because the sight of them, knowing how
soon they were to be left motherless, would have agitated her too much.&nbsp;
So the little things clung quietly together, for their father was busy
in his study and in his parish, or with their mother, and they took
their meals alone; sat reading, or whispering low, in the &ldquo;children&rsquo;s
study,&rdquo; or wandered out on the hill-side, hand in hand.</p>
<p>The ideas of Rousseau and Mr. Day on education had filtered down
through many classes, and spread themselves widely out.&nbsp; I imagine,
Mr. Bront&euml; must have formed some of his opinions on the management
of children from these two theorists.&nbsp; His practice was not half
so wild or extraordinary as that to which an aunt of mine was subjected
by a disciple of Mr. Day&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She had been taken by this gentleman
and his wife, to live with them as their adopted child, perhaps about
five-and-twenty years before the time of which I am writing.&nbsp; They
were wealthy people and kind hearted, but her food and clothing were
of the very simplest and rudest description, on Spartan principles.&nbsp;
A healthy, merry child, she did not much care for dress or eating; but
the treatment which she felt as a real cruelty was this.&nbsp; They
had a carriage, in which she and the favourite dog were taken an airing
on alternate days; the creature whose turn it was to be left at home
being tossed in a blanket&mdash;an operation which my aunt especially
dreaded.&nbsp; Her affright at the tossing was probably the reason why
it was persevered in.&nbsp; Dressed-up ghosts had become common, and
she did not care for them, so the blanket exercise was to be the next
mode of hardening her nerves.&nbsp; It is well known that Mr. Day broke
off his intention of marrying Sabrina, the girl whom he had educated
for this purpose, because, within a few weeks of the time fixed for
the wedding, she was guilty of the frivolity, while on a visit from
home, of wearing thin sleeves.&nbsp; Yet Mr. Day and my aunt&rsquo;s
relations were benevolent people, only strongly imbued with the crotchet
that by a system of training might be educed the hardihood and simplicity
of the ideal savage, forgetting the terrible isolation of feelings and
habits which their pupils would experience in the future life which
they must pass among the corruptions and refinements of civilization.</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; wished to make his children hardy, and indifferent
to the pleasures of eating and dress.&nbsp; In the latter he succeeded,
as far as regarded his daughters.</p>
<p>His strong, passionate, Irish nature was, in general, compressed
down with resolute stoicism; but it was there notwithstanding all his
philosophic calm and dignity of demeanour; though he did not speak when
he was annoyed or displeased.&nbsp; Mrs. Bront&euml;, whose sweet nature
thought invariably of the bright side, would say, &ldquo;Ought I not
to be thankful that he never gave me an angry word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; was an active walker, stretching away over the moors
for many miles, noting in his mind all natural signs of wind and weather,
and keenly observing all the wild creatures that came and went in the
loneliest sweeps of the hills.&nbsp; He has seen eagles stooping low
in search of food for their young; no eagle is ever seen on those mountain
slopes now.</p>
<p>He fearlessly took whatever side in local or national politics appeared
to him right.&nbsp; In the days of the Luddites, he had been for the
peremptory interference of the law, at a time when no magistrate could
be found to act, and all the property of the West Riding was in terrible
danger.&nbsp; He became unpopular then among the millworkers, and he
esteemed his life unsafe if he took his long and lonely walks unarmed;
so he began the habit, which has continued to this day, of invariably
carrying a loaded pistol about with him.&nbsp; It lay on his dressing-table
with his watch; with his watch it was put on in the morning; with his
watch it was taken off at night.</p>
<p>Many years later, during his residence at Haworth, there was a strike;
the hands in the neighbourhood felt themselves aggrieved by the masters,
and refused to work: Mr. Bront&euml; thought that they had been unjustly
and unfairly treated, and he assisted them by all the means in his power
to &ldquo;keep the wolf from their doors,&rdquo; and avoid the incubus
of debt.&nbsp; Several of the more influential inhabitants of Haworth
and the neighbourhood were mill-owners; they remonstrated pretty sharply
with him, but he believed that his conduct was right and persevered
in it.</p>
<p>His opinions might be often both wild and erroneous, his principles
of action eccentric and strange, his views of life partial, and almost
misanthropical; but not one opinion that he held could be stirred or
modified by any worldly motive: he acted up to his principles of action;
and, if any touch of misanthropy mingled with his view of mankind in
general, his conduct to the individuals who came in personal contact
with him did not agree with such view.&nbsp; It is true that he had
strong and vehement prejudices, and was obstinate in maintaining them,
and that he was not dramatic enough in his perceptions to see how miserable
others might be in a life that to him was all-sufficient.&nbsp; But
I do not pretend to be able to harmonize points of character, and account
for them, and bring them all into one consistent and intelligible whole.&nbsp;
The family with whom I have now to do shot their roots down deeper than
I can penetrate.&nbsp; I cannot measure them, much less is it for me
to judge them.&nbsp; I have named these instances of eccentricity in
the father because I hold the knowledge of them to be necessary for
a right understanding of the life of his daughter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bront&euml; died in September, 1821, and the lives of those
quiet children must have become quieter and lonelier still.&nbsp; Charlotte
tried hard, in after years, to recall the remembrance of her mother,
and could bring back two or three pictures of her.&nbsp; One was when,
sometime in the evening light, she had been playing with her little
boy, Patrick Branwell, in the parlour of Haworth Parsonage.&nbsp; But
the recollections of four or five years old are of a very fragmentary
character.</p>
<p>Owing to some illness of the digestive organs, Mr. Bront&euml; was
obliged to be very careful about his diet; and, in order to avoid temptation,
and possibly to have the quiet necessary for digestion, he had begun,
before his wife&rsquo;s death, to take his dinner alone&mdash;a habit
which he always retained.&nbsp; He did not require companionship, therefore
he did not seek it, either in his walks, or in his daily life.&nbsp;
The quiet regularity of his domestic hours was only broken in upon by
church-wardens, and visitors on parochial business; and sometimes by
a neighbouring clergyman, who came down the hills, across the moors,
to mount up again to Haworth Parsonage, and spend an evening there.&nbsp;
But, owing to Mrs. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s death so soon after her husband
had removed into the district, and also to the distances, and the bleak
country to be traversed, the wives of these clerical friends did not
accompany their husbands; and the daughters grew up out of childhood
into girlhood bereft, in a singular manner, of all such society as would
have been natural to their age, sex, and station.</p>
<p>But the children did not want society.&nbsp; To small infantine gaieties
they were unaccustomed.&nbsp; They were all in all to each other.&nbsp;
I do not suppose that there ever was a family more tenderly bound to
each other.&nbsp; Maria read the newspapers, and reported intelligence
to her younger sisters which it is wonderful they could take an interest
in.&nbsp; But I suspect that they had no &ldquo;children&rsquo;s books,&rdquo;
and that their eager minds &ldquo;browzed undisturbed among the wholesome
pasturage of English literature,&rdquo; as Charles Lamb expresses it.&nbsp;
The servants of the household appear to have been much impressed with
the little Bront&euml;s&rsquo; extraordinary cleverness.&nbsp; In a
letter which I had from him on this subject, their father writes:&mdash;&ldquo;The
servants often said that they had never seen such a clever little child&rdquo;
(as Charlotte), &ldquo;and that they were obliged to be on their guard
as to what they said and did before her.&nbsp; Yet she and the servants
always lived on good terms with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These servants are yet alive; elderly women residing in Bradford.&nbsp;
They retain a faithful and fond recollection of Charlotte, and speak
of her unvarying kindness from the &ldquo;time when she was ever such
a little child!&rdquo; when she would not rest till she had got the
old disused cradle sent from the parsonage to the house where the parents
of one of them lived, to serve for a little infant sister.&nbsp; They
tell of one long series of kind and thoughtful actions from this early
period to the last weeks of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s life; and,
though she had left her place many years ago, one of these former servants
went over from Bradford to Haworth on purpose to see Mr. Bront&euml;,
and offer him her true sympathy, when his last child died.&nbsp; I may
add a little anecdote as a testimony to the admirable character of the
likeness of Miss Bront&euml; prefixed to this volume.&nbsp; A gentleman
who had kindly interested himself in the preparation of this memoir
took the first volume, shortly after the publication, to the house of
this old servant, in order to show her the portrait.&nbsp; The moment
she caught a glimpse of the frontispiece, &ldquo;There she is,&rdquo;
in a minute she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, John, look!&rdquo; (to
her husband); and her daughter was equally struck by the resemblance.&nbsp;
There might not be many to regard the Bront&euml;s with affection, but
those who once loved them, loved them long and well.</p>
<p>I return to the father&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When mere children, as soon as they could read and write,
Charlotte and her brothers and sisters used to invent and act little
plays of their own, in which the Duke of Wellington, my daughter Charlotte&rsquo;s
hero, was sure to come off conqueror; when a dispute would not unfrequently
arise amongst them regarding the comparative merits of him, Buonaparte,
Hannibal, and C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; When the argument got warm, and rose
to its height, as their mother was then dead, I had sometimes to come
in as arbitrator, and settle the dispute according to the best of my
judgment.&nbsp; Generally, in the management of these concerns, I frequently
thought that I discovered signs of rising talent, which I had seldom
or never before seen in any of their age . . . A circumstance now occurs
to my mind which I may as well mention.&nbsp; When my children were
very young, when, as far as I can remember, the oldest was about ten
years of age, and the youngest about four, thinking that they knew more
than I had yet discovered, in order to make them speak with less timidity,
I deemed that if they were put under a sort of cover I might gain my
end; and happening to have a mask in the house, I told them all to stand
and speak boldly from under cover of the mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began with the youngest (Anne, afterwards Acton Bell), and
asked what a child like her most wanted; she answered, &lsquo;Age and
experience.&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked the next (Emily, afterwards Ellis Bell),
what I had best do with her brother Branwell, who was sometimes a naughty
boy; she answered, &lsquo;Reason with him, and when he won&rsquo;t listen
to reason, whip him.&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked Branwell what was the best
way of knowing the difference between the intellects of man and woman;
he answered, &lsquo;By considering the difference between them as to
their bodies.&rsquo;&nbsp; I then asked Charlotte what was the best
book in the world; she answered, &lsquo;The Bible.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
what was the next best; she answered, &lsquo;The Book of Nature.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I then asked the next what was the best mode of education for a woman;
she answered, &lsquo;That which would make her rule her house well.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Lastly, I asked the oldest what was the best mode of spending time;
she answered, &lsquo;By laying it out in preparation for a happy eternity.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I may not have given precisely their words, but I have nearly done so,
as they made a deep and lasting impression on my memory.&nbsp; The substance,
however, was exactly what I have stated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strange and quaint simplicity of the mode taken by the father
to ascertain the hidden characters of his children, and the tone and
character of these questions and answers, show the curious education
which was made by the circumstances surrounding the Bront&euml;s.&nbsp;
They knew no other children.&nbsp; They knew no other modes of thought
than what were suggested to them by the fragments of clerical conversation
which they overheard in the parlour, or the subjects of village and
local interest which they heard discussed in the kitchen.&nbsp; Each
had their own strong characteristic flavour.</p>
<p>They took a vivid interest in the public characters, and the local
and the foreign as well as home politics discussed in the newspapers.&nbsp;
Long before Maria Bront&euml; died, at the age of eleven, her father
used to say he could converse with her on any of the leading topics
of the day with as much freedom and pleasure as with any grown-up person.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>About a year after Mrs. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s death, an elder sister,
as I have before mentioned, came from Penzance to superintend her brother-in-law&rsquo;s
household, and look after his children.&nbsp; Miss Branwell was, I believe,
a kindly and conscientious woman, with a good deal of character, but
with the somewhat narrow ideas natural to one who had spent nearly all
her life in the same place.&nbsp; She had strong prejudices, and soon
took a distaste to Yorkshire.&nbsp; From Penzance, where plants which
we in the north call greenhouse flowers grow in great profusion, and
without any shelter even in the winter, and where the soft warm climate
allows the inhabitants, if so disposed, to live pretty constantly in
the open air, it was a great change for a lady considerably past forty
to come and take up her abode in a place where neither flowers nor vegetables
would flourish, and where a tree of even moderate dimensions might be
hunted for far and wide; where the snow lay long and late on the moors,
stretching bleakly and barely far up from the dwelling which was henceforward
to be her home; and where often, on autumnal or winter nights, the four
winds of heaven seemed to meet and rage together, tearing round the
house as if they were wild beasts striving to find an entrance.&nbsp;
She missed the small round of cheerful, social visiting perpetually
going on in a country town; she missed the friends she had known from
her childhood, some of whom had been her parents&rsquo; friends before
they were hers; she disliked many of the customs of the place, and particularly
dreaded the cold damp arising from the flag floors in the passages and
parlours of Haworth Parsonage.&nbsp; The stairs, too, I believe, are
made of stone; and no wonder, when stone quarries are near, and trees
are far to seek.&nbsp; I have heard that Miss Branwell always went about
the house in pattens, clicking up and down the stairs, from her dread
of catching cold.&nbsp; For the same reason, in the latter years of
her life, she passed nearly all her time, and took most of her meals,
in her bedroom.&nbsp; The children respected her, and had that sort
of affection for her which is generated by esteem; but I do not think
they ever freely loved her.&nbsp; It was a severe trial for any one
at her time of life to change neighbourhood and habitation so entirely
as she did; and the greater her merit.</p>
<p>I do not know whether Miss Branwell taught her nieces anything besides
sewing, and the household arts in which Charlotte afterwards was such
an adept.&nbsp; Their regular lessons were said to their father; and
they were always in the habit of picking up an immense amount of miscellaneous
information for themselves.&nbsp; But a year or so before this time,
a school had been begun in the North of England for the daughters of
clergymen.&nbsp; The place was Cowan Bridge, a small hamlet on the coach-road
between Leeds and Kendal, and thus easy of access from Haworth, as the
coach ran daily, and one of its stages was at Keighley.&nbsp; The yearly
expense for each pupil (according to the entrance-rules given in the
Report for 1842, and I believe they had not been increased since the
establishment of the schools in 1823) was as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rule 11.&nbsp; The terms for clothing, lodging, boarding,
and educating, are 14<i>l</i>. a year; half to be paid in advance, when
the pupils are sent; and also 1<i>l</i>. entrance-money, for the use
of books, &amp;c.&nbsp; The system of education comprehends history,
geography, the use of the globes, grammar, writing and arithmetic, all
kinds of needlework, and the nicer kinds of household work&mdash;such
as getting up fine linen, ironing, &amp;c.&nbsp; If accomplishments
are required, an additional charge of 3<i>l</i>. a year is made for
music or drawing, each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rule 3rd requests that the friends will state the line of education
desired in the case of every pupil, having a regard to her future prospects.</p>
<p>Rule 4th states the clothing and toilette articles which a girl is
expected to bring with her; and thus concludes: &ldquo;The pupils all
appear in the same dress.&nbsp; They wear plain straw cottage bonnets;
in summer white frocks on Sundays, and nankeen on other days; in winter,
purple stuff frocks, and purple cloth cloaks.&nbsp; For the sake of
uniformity, therefore, they are required to bring 3<i>l</i>. in lieu
of frocks, pelisse, bonnet, tippet, and frills; making the whole sum
which each pupil brings with her to the school&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>7<i>l</i>. half-year in advance.<br />
1<i>l</i>. entrance for books.<br />
1<i>l</i>. entrance for clothes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 8th rule is,&mdash;&ldquo;All letters and parcels are inspected
by the superintendent;&rdquo; but this is a very prevalent regulation
in all young ladies&rsquo; schools, where I think it is generally understood
that the schoolmistress may exercise this privilege, although it is
certainly unwise in her to insist too frequently upon it.</p>
<p>There is nothing at all remarkable in any of the other regulations,
a copy of which was doubtless in Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s hands when
he formed the determination to send his daughters to Cowan Bridge School;
and he accordingly took Maria and Elizabeth thither in July, 1824.</p>
<p>I now come to a part of my subject which I find great difficulty
in treating, because the evidence relating to it on each side is so
conflicting that it seems almost impossible to arrive at the truth.&nbsp;
Miss Bront&euml; more than once said to me, that she should not have
written what she did of Lowood in &ldquo;Jane Eyre,&rdquo; if she had
thought the place would have been so immediately identified with Cowan
Bridge, although there was not a word in her account of the institution
but what was true at the time when she knew it; she also said that she
had not considered it necessary, in a work of fiction, to state every
particular with the impartiality that might be required in a court of
justice, nor to seek out motives, and make allowances for human failings,
as she might have done, if dispassionately analysing the conduct of
those who had the superintendence of the institution.&nbsp; I believe
she herself would have been glad of an opportunity to correct the over-strong
impression which was made upon the public mind by her vivid picture,
though even she, suffering her whole life long, both in heart and body,
from the consequences of what happened there, might have been apt, to
the last, to take her deep belief in facts for the facts themselves&mdash;her
conception of truth for the absolute truth.</p>
<p>In some of the notices of the previous editions of this work, it
is assumed that I derived the greater part of my information with regard
to her sojourn at Cowan Bridge from Charlotte Bront&euml; herself.&nbsp;
I never heard her speak of the place but once, and that was on the second
day of my acquaintance with her.&nbsp; A little child on that occasion
expressed some reluctance to finish eating his piece of bread at dinner;
and she, stooping down, and addressing him in a low voice, told him
how thankful she should have been at his age for a piece of bread; and
when we&mdash;though I am not sure if I myself spoke&mdash;asked her
some question as to the occasion she alluded to, she replied with reserve
and hesitation, evidently shying away from what she imagined might lead
to too much conversation on one of her books.&nbsp; She spoke of the
oat-cake at Cowan Bridge (the clap-bread of Westmorland) as being different
to the leaven-raised oat-cake of Yorkshire, and of her childish distaste
for it.&nbsp; Some one present made an allusion to a similar childish
dislike in the true tale of &ldquo;The terrible knitters o&rsquo; Dent&rdquo;
given in Southey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Common-place Book:&rdquo; and she smiled
faintly, but said that the mere difference in food was not all: that
the food itself was spoilt by the dirty carelessness of the cook, so
that she and her sisters disliked their meals exceedingly; and she named
her relief and gladness when the doctor condemned the meat, and spoke
of having seen him spit it out.&nbsp; These are all the details I ever
heard from her.&nbsp; She so avoided particularizing, that I think Mr.
Carus Wilson&rsquo;s name never passed between us.</p>
<p>I do not doubt the general accuracy of my informants,&mdash;of those
who have given, and solemnly repeated, the details that follow,&mdash;but
it is only just to Miss Bront&euml; to say that I have stated above
pretty nearly all that I ever heard on the subject from her.</p>
<p>A clergyman, living near Kirby Lonsdale, the Reverend William Carus
Wilson, was the prime mover in the establishment of this school.&nbsp;
He was an energetic man, sparing no labour for the accomplishment of
his ends.&nbsp; He saw that it was an extremely difficult task for clergymen
with limited incomes to provide for the education of their children;
and he devised a scheme, by which a certain sum was raised annually
by subscription, to complete the amount required to furnish a solid
and sufficient English education, for which the parent&rsquo;s payment
of 14<i>l</i>. a year would not have been sufficient.&nbsp; Indeed,
that made by the parents was considered to be exclusively appropriated
to the expenses of lodging and boarding, and the education provided
for by the subscriptions.&nbsp; Twelve trustees were appointed; Mr.
Wilson being not only a trustee, but the treasurer and secretary; in
fact, taking most of the business arrangements upon himself; a responsibility
which appropriately fell to him, as he lived nearer the school than
any one else who was interested in it.&nbsp; So his character for prudence
and judgment was to a certain degree implicated in the success or failure
of Cowan Bridge School; and the working of it was for many years the
great object and interest of his life.&nbsp; But he was apparently unacquainted
with the prime element in good administration&mdash;seeking out thoroughly
competent persons to fill each department, and then making them responsible
for, and judging them by, the result, without perpetual interference
with the details.</p>
<p>So great was the amount of good which Mr. Wilson did, by his constant,
unwearied superintendence, that I cannot help feeling sorry that, in
his old age and declining health, the errors which he was believed to
have committed, should have been brought up against him in a form which
received such wonderful force from the touch of Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
great genius.&nbsp; No doubt whatever can be entertained of the deep
interest which he felt in the success of the school.&nbsp; As I write,
I have before me his last words on giving up the secretaryship in 1850:
he speaks of the &ldquo;withdrawal, from declining health, of an eye,
which, at all events, has loved to watch over the schools with an honest
and anxious interest;&rdquo;&mdash;and again he adds, &ldquo;that he
resigns, therefore, with a desire to be thankful for all that God has
been pleased to accomplish through his instrumentality (the infirmities
and unworthinesses of which he deeply feels and deplores).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cowan Bridge is a cluster of some six or seven cottages, gathered
together at both ends of a bridge, over which the high road from Leeds
to Kendal crosses a little stream, called the Leck.&nbsp; This high
road is nearly disused now; but formerly, when the buyers from the West
Riding manufacturing districts had frequent occasion to go up into the
North to purchase the wool of the Westmorland and Cumberland farmers,
it was doubtless much travelled; and perhaps the hamlet of Cowan Bridge
had a more prosperous look than it bears at present.&nbsp; It is prettily
situated; just where the Leck-fells swoop into the plain; and by the
course of the beck alder-trees and willows and hazel bushes grow.&nbsp;
The current of the stream is interrupted by broken pieces of grey rock;
and the waters flow over a bed of large round white pebbles, which a
flood heaves up and moves on either side out of its impetuous way till
in some parts they almost form a wall.&nbsp; By the side of the little,
shallow, sparkling, vigorous Leck, run long pasture fields, of the fine
short grass common in high land; for though Cowan Bridge is situated
on a plain, it is a plain from which there is many a fall and long descent
before you and the Leck reach the valley of the Lune.&nbsp; I can hardly
understand how the school there came to be so unhealthy, the air all
round about was so sweet and thyme-scented, when I visited it last summer.&nbsp;
But at this day, every one knows that the site of a building intended
for numbers should be chosen with far greater care than that of a private
dwelling, from the tendency to illness, both infectious and otherwise,
produced by the congregation of people in close proximity.</p>
<p>The house is still remaining that formed part of that occupied by
the school.&nbsp; It is a long, bow-windowed cottage, now divided into
two dwellings.&nbsp; It stands facing the Leck, between which and it
intervenes a space, about seventy yards deep, that was once the school
garden.&nbsp; This original house was an old dwelling of the Picard
family, which they had inhabited for two generations.&nbsp; They sold
it for school purposes, and an additional building was erected, running
at right angles from the older part.&nbsp; This new part was devoted
expressly to schoolrooms, dormitories, &amp;c.; and after the school
was removed to Casterton, it was used for a bobbin-mill connected with
the stream, where wooden reels were made out of the alders, which grow
profusely in such ground as that surrounding Cowan Bridge.&nbsp; This
mill is now destroyed.&nbsp; The present cottage was, at the time of
which I write, occupied by the teachers&rsquo; rooms, the dinner-room
and kitchens, and some smaller bedrooms.&nbsp; On going into this building,
I found one part, that nearest to the high road, converted into a poor
kind of public-house, then to let, and having all the squalid appearance
of a deserted place, which rendered it difficult to judge what it would
look like when neatly kept up, the broken panes replaced in the windows,
and the rough-cast (now cracked and discoloured) made white and whole.&nbsp;
The other end forms a cottage, with the low ceilings and stone floors
of a hundred years ago; the windows do not open freely and widely; and
the passage upstairs, leading to the bedrooms, is narrow and tortuous:
altogether, smells would linger about the house, and damp cling to it.&nbsp;
But sanitary matters were little understood thirty years ago; and it
was a great thing to get a roomy building close to the high road, and
not too far from the habitation of Mr. Wilson, the originator of the
educational scheme.&nbsp; There was much need of such an institution;
numbers of ill-paid clergymen hailed the prospect with joy, and eagerly
put down the names of their children as pupils when the establishment
should be ready to receive them.&nbsp; Mr. Wilson was, no doubt, pleased
by the impatience with which the realisation of his idea was anticipated,
and opened the school with less than a hundred pounds in hand, and with
pupils, the number of whom varies according to different accounts; Mr.
W. W. Carus Wilson, the son of the founder, giving it as seventy; while
Mr. Shepheard, the son-in-law, states it to have been only sixteen.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson felt, most probably, that the responsibility of the whole
plan rested upon him.&nbsp; The payment made by the parents was barely
enough for food and lodging; the subscriptions did not flow very freely
into an untried scheme; and great economy was necessary in all the domestic
arrangements.&nbsp; He determined to enforce this by frequent personal
inspection; carried perhaps to an unnecessary extent, and leading occasionally
to a meddling with little matters, which had sometimes the effect of
producing irritation of feeling.&nbsp; Yet, although there was economy
in providing for the household, there does not appear to have been any
parsimony.&nbsp; The meat, flour, milk, &amp;c., were contracted for,
but were of very fair quality; and the dietary, which has been shown
to me in manuscript, was neither bad nor unwholesome; nor, on the whole,
was it wanting in variety.&nbsp; Oatmeal porridge for breakfast; a piece
of oat-cake for those who required luncheon; baked and boiled beef,
and mutton, potato-pie, and plain homely puddings of different kinds
for dinner.&nbsp; At five o&rsquo;clock, bread and milk for the younger
ones; and one piece of bread (this was the only time at which the food
was limited) for the elder pupils, who sat up till a later meal of the
same description.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson himself ordered in the food, and was anxious that it should
be of good quality.&nbsp; But the cook, who had much of his confidence,
and against whom for a long time no one durst utter a complaint, was
careless, dirty, and wasteful.&nbsp; To some children oatmeal porridge
is distasteful, and consequently unwholesome, even when properly made;
at Cowan Bridge School it was too often sent up, not merely burnt, but
with offensive fragments of other substances discoverable in it.&nbsp;
The beef, that should have been carefully salted before it was dressed,
had often become tainted from neglect; and girls, who were school-fellows
with the Bront&euml;s, during the reign of the cook of whom I am speaking,
tell me that the house seemed to be pervaded, morning, noon, and night,
by the odour of rancid fat that steamed out of the oven in which much
of their food was prepared.&nbsp; There was the same carelessness in
making the puddings; one of those ordered was rice boiled in water,
and eaten with a sauce of treacle and sugar; but it was often uneatable,
because the water had been taken out of the rain tub, and was strongly
impregnated with the dust lodging on the roof, whence it had trickled
down into the old wooden cask, which also added its own flavour to that
of the original rain water.&nbsp; The milk, too, was often &ldquo;bingy,&rdquo;
to use a country expression for a kind of taint that is far worse than
sourness, and suggests the idea that it is caused by want of cleanliness
about the milk pans, rather than by the heat of the weather.&nbsp; On
Saturdays, a kind of pie, or mixture of potatoes and meat, was served
up, which was made of all the fragments accumulated during the week.&nbsp;
Scraps of meat from a dirty and disorderly larder, could never be very
appetizing; and, I believe, that this dinner was more loathed than any
in the early days of Cowan Bridge School.&nbsp; One may fancy how repulsive
such fare would be to children whose appetites were small, and who had
been accustomed to food, far simpler perhaps, but prepared with a delicate
cleanliness that made it both tempting and wholesome.&nbsp; At many
a meal the little Bront&euml;s went without food, although craving with
hunger.&nbsp; They were not strong when they came, having only just
recovered from a complication of measles and hooping-cough: indeed,
I suspect they had scarcely recovered; for there was some consultation
on the part of the school authorities whether Maria and Elizabeth should
be received or not, in July 1824.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; came again,
in the September of that year, bringing with him Charlotte and Emily
to be admitted as pupils.</p>
<p>It appears strange that Mr. Wilson should not have been informed
by the teachers of the way in which the food was served up; but we must
remember that the cook had been known for some time to the Wilson family,
while the teachers were brought together for an entirely different work&mdash;that
of education.&nbsp; They were expressly given to understand that such
was their department; the buying in and management of the provisions
rested with Mr. Wilson and the cook.&nbsp; The teachers would, of course,
be unwilling to lay any complaints on the subject before him.</p>
<p>There was another trial of health common to all the girls.&nbsp;
The path from Cowan Bridge to Tunstall Church, where Mr. Wilson preached,
and where they all attended on the Sunday, is more than two miles in
length, and goes sweeping along the rise and fall of the unsheltered
country, in a way to make it a fresh and exhilarating walk in summer,
but a bitter cold one in winter, especially to children like the delicate
little Bront&euml;s, whose thin blood flowed languidly in consequence
of their feeble appetites rejecting the food prepared for them, and
thus inducing a half-starved condition.&nbsp; The church was not warmed,
there being no means for this purpose.&nbsp; It stands in the midst
of fields, and the damp mist must have gathered round the walls, and
crept in at the windows.&nbsp; The girls took their cold dinner with
them, and ate it between the services, in a chamber over the entrance,
opening out of the former galleries.&nbsp; The arrangements for this
day were peculiarly trying to delicate children, particularly to those
who were spiritless and longing for home, as poor Maria Bront&euml;
must have been; for her ill health was increasing, and the old cough,
the remains of the hooping-cough, lingered about her.</p>
<p>She was far superior in mind to any of her play-fellows and companions,
and was lonely amongst them from that very cause; and yet she had faults
so annoying that she was in constant disgrace with her teachers, and
an object of merciless dislike to one of them, who is depicted as &ldquo;Miss
Scatcherd&rdquo; in &ldquo;Jane Eyre,&rdquo; and whose real name I will
be merciful enough not to disclose.&nbsp; I need hardly say, that Helen
Burns is as exact a transcript of Maria Bront&euml; as Charlotte&rsquo;s
wonderful power of reproducing character could give.&nbsp; Her heart,
to the latest day on which we met, still beat with unavailing indignation
at the worrying and the cruelty to which her gentle, patient, dying
sister had been subjected by this woman.&nbsp; Not a word of that part
of &ldquo;Jane Eyre&rdquo; but is a literal repetition of scenes between
the pupil and the teacher.&nbsp; Those who had been pupils at the same
time knew who must have written the book from the force with which Helen
Burns&rsquo; sufferings are described.&nbsp; They had, before that,
recognised the description of the sweet dignity and benevolence of Miss
Temple as only a just tribute to the merits of one whom all that knew
her appear to hold in honour; but when Miss Scatcherd was held up to
opprobrium they also recognised in the writer of &ldquo;Jane Eyre&rdquo;
an unconsciously avenging sister of the sufferer.</p>
<p>One of their fellow-pupils, among other statements even worse, gives
me the following:&mdash;The dormitory in which Maria slept was a long
room, holding a row of narrow little beds on each side, occupied by
the pupils; and at the end of this dormitory there was a small bed-chamber
opening out of it, appropriated to the use of Miss Scatcherd.&nbsp;
Maria&rsquo;s bed stood nearest to the door of this room.&nbsp; One
morning, after she had become so seriously unwell as to have had a blister
applied to her side (the sore from which was not perfectly healed),
when the getting-up bell was heard, poor Maria moaned out that she was
so ill, so very ill, she wished she might stop in bed; and some of the
girls urged her to do so, and said they would explain it all to Miss
Temple, the superintendent.&nbsp; But Miss Scatcherd was close at hand,
and her anger would have to be faced before Miss Temple&rsquo;s kind
thoughtfulness could interfere; so the sick child began to dress, shivering
with cold, as, without leaving her bed, she slowly put on her black
worsted stockings over her thin white legs (my informant spoke as if
she saw it yet, and her whole face flushed out undying indignation).&nbsp;
Just then Miss Scatcherd issued from her room, and, without asking for
a word of explanation from the sick and frightened girl, she took her
by the arm, on the side to which the blister had been applied, and by
one vigorous movement whirled her out into the middle of the floor,
abusing her all the time for dirty and untidy habits.&nbsp; There she
left her.&nbsp; My informant says, Maria hardly spoke, except to beg
some of the more indignant girls to be calm; but, in slow, trembling
movements, with many a pause, she went down-stairs at last,&mdash;and
was punished for being late.</p>
<p>Any one may fancy how such an event as this would rankle in Charlotte&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; I only wonder that she did not remonstrate against her father&rsquo;s
decision to send her and Emily back to Cowan Bridge, after Maria&rsquo;s
and Elizabeth&rsquo;s deaths.&nbsp; But frequently children are unconscious
of the effect which some of their simple revelations would have in altering
the opinions entertained by their friends of the persons placed around
them.&nbsp; Besides, Charlotte&rsquo;s earnest vigorous mind saw, at
an unusually early age, the immense importance of education, as furnishing
her with tools which she had the strength and the will to wield, and
she would be aware that the Cowan Bridge education was, in many points,
the best that her father could provide for her.</p>
<p>Before Maria Bront&euml;&rsquo;s death, that low fever broke out,
in the spring of 1825, which is spoken of in &ldquo;Jane Eyre.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Wilson was extremely alarmed at the first symptoms of this.&nbsp;
He went to a kind motherly woman, who had had some connection with the
school&mdash;as laundress, I believe&mdash;and asked her to come and
tell him what was the matter with them.&nbsp; She made herself ready,
and drove with him in his gig.&nbsp; When she entered the schoolroom,
she saw from twelve to fifteen girls lying about; some resting their
aching heads on the table, others on the ground; all heavy-eyed, flushed,
indifferent, and weary, with pains in every limb.&nbsp; Some peculiar
odour, she says, made her recognise that they were sickening for &ldquo;the
fever;&rdquo; and she told Mr. Wilson so, and that she could not stay
there for fear of conveying the infection to her own children; but he
half commanded, and half entreated her to remain and nurse them; and
finally mounted his gig and drove away, while she was still urging that
she must return to her own house, and to her domestic duties, for which
she had provided no substitute.&nbsp; However, when she was left in
this unceremonious manner, she determined to make the best of it; and
a most efficient nurse she proved: although, as she says, it was a dreary
time.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson supplied everything ordered by the doctors, of the best
quality and in the most liberal manner; the invalids were attended by
Dr. Batty, a very clever surgeon in Kirby, who had had the medical superintendence
of the establishment from the beginning, and who afterwards became Mr.
Wilson&rsquo;s brother-in-law.&nbsp; I have heard from two witnesses
besides Charlotte Bront&euml;, that Dr. Batty condemned the preparation
of the food by the expressive action of spitting out a portion of it.&nbsp;
He himself, it is but fair to say, does not remember this circumstance,
nor does he speak of the fever itself as either alarming or dangerous.&nbsp;
About forty of the girls suffered from this, but none of them died at
Cowan Bridge; though one died at her own home, sinking under the state
of health which followed it.&nbsp; None of the Bront&euml;s had the
fever.&nbsp; But the same causes, which affected the health of the other
pupils through typhus, told more slowly, but not less surely, upon their
constitutions.&nbsp; The principal of these causes was the food.</p>
<p>The bad management of the cook was chiefly to be blamed for this;
she was dismissed, and the woman who had been forced against her will
to serve as head nurse, took the place of housekeeper; and henceforward
the food was so well prepared that no one could ever reasonably complain
of it.&nbsp; Of course it cannot be expected that a new institution,
comprising domestic and educational arrangements for nearly a hundred
persons, should work quite smoothly at the beginning.</p>
<p>All this occurred during the first two years of the establishment,
and in estimating its effect upon the character of Charlotte Bront&euml;,
we must remember that she was a sensitive thoughtful child, capable
of reflecting deeply, if not of analyzing truly; and peculiarly susceptible,
as are all delicate and sickly children, to painful impressions.&nbsp;
What the healthy suffer from but momentarily and then forget, those
who are ailing brood over involuntarily and remember long,&mdash;perhaps
with no resentment, but simply as a piece of suffering that has been
stamped into their very life.&nbsp; The pictures, ideas, and conceptions
of character received into the mind of the child of eight years old,
were destined to be reproduced in fiery words a quarter of a century
afterwards.&nbsp; She saw but one side of Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s character;
and many of those who knew him at that time assure me of the fidelity
with which this is represented, while at the same time they regret that
the delineation should have obliterated, as it were, nearly all that
was noble or conscientious.&nbsp; And that there were grand and fine
qualities in Mr. Wilson, I have received abundant evidence.&nbsp; Indeed
for several weeks past I have received letters almost daily, bearing
on the subject of this chapter; some vague, some definite; many full
of love and admiration for Mr. Wilson, some as full of dislike and indignation;
few containing positive facts.&nbsp; After giving careful consideration
to this mass of conflicting evidence, I have made such alterations and
omissions in this chapter as seem to me to be required.&nbsp; It is
but just to state that the major part of the testimony with which I
have been favoured from old pupils is in high praise of Mr. Wilson.&nbsp;
Among the letters that I have read, there is one whose evidence ought
to be highly respected.&nbsp; It is from the husband of &ldquo;Miss
Temple.&rdquo;&nbsp; She died in 1856, but he, a clergyman, thus wrote
in reply to a letter addressed to him on the subject by one of Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s
friends:&mdash;&ldquo;Often have I heard my late dear wife speak of
her sojourn at Cowan Bridge; always in terms of admiration of Mr. Carus
Wilson, his parental love to his pupils, and their love for him; of
the food and general treatment, in terms of approval.&nbsp; I have heard
her allude to an unfortunate cook, who used at times to spoil the porridge,
but who, she said, was soon dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The recollections left of the four Bront&euml; sisters at this period
of their lives, on the minds of those who associated with them, are
not very distinct.&nbsp; Wild, strong hearts, and powerful minds, were
hidden under an enforced propriety and regularity of demeanour and expression,
just as their faces had been concealed by their father, under his stiff,
unchanging mask.&nbsp; Maria was delicate, unusually clever and thoughtful
for her age, gentle, and untidy.&nbsp; Of her frequent disgrace from
this last fault&mdash;of her sufferings, so patiently borne&mdash;I
have already spoken.&nbsp; The only glimpse we get of Elizabeth, through
the few years of her short life, is contained in a letter which I have
received from &ldquo;Miss Temple.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The second, Elizabeth,
is the only one of the family of whom I have a vivid recollection, from
her meeting with a somewhat alarming accident, in consequence of which
I had her for some days and nights in my bedroom, not only for the sake
of greater quiet, but that I might watch over her myself.&nbsp; Her
head was severely cut, but she bore all the consequent suffering with
exemplary patience, and by it won much upon my esteem.&nbsp; Of the
two younger ones (if two there were) I have very slight recollections,
save that one, a darling child, under five years of age, was quite the
pet nursling of the school.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last would be Emily.&nbsp;
Charlotte was considered the most talkative of the sisters&mdash;a &ldquo;bright,
clever, little child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her great friend was a certain &ldquo;Mellany
Hane&rdquo; (so Mr. Bront&euml; spells the name), whose brother paid
for her schooling, and who had no remarkable talent except for music,
which her brother&rsquo;s circumstances forbade her to cultivate.&nbsp;
She was &ldquo;a hungry, good-natured, ordinary girl;&rdquo; older than
Charlotte, and ever ready to protect her from any petty tyranny or encroachments
on the part of the elder girls.&nbsp; Charlotte always remembered her
with affection and gratitude.</p>
<p>I have quoted the word &ldquo;bright&rdquo; in the account of Charlotte.&nbsp;
I suspect that this year of 1825 was the last time it could ever be
applied to her.&nbsp; In the spring of it, Maria became so rapidly worse
that Mr. Bront&euml; was sent for.&nbsp; He had not previously been
aware of her illness, and the condition in which he found her was a
terrible shock to him.&nbsp; He took her home by the Leeds coach, the
girls crowding out into the road to follow her with their eyes over
the bridge, past the cottages, and then out of sight for ever.&nbsp;
She died a very few days after her arrival at home.&nbsp; Perhaps the
news of her death falling suddenly into the life of which her patient
existence had formed a part, only a little week or so before, made those
who remained at Cowan Bridge look with more anxiety on Elizabeth&rsquo;s
symptoms, which also turned out to be consumptive.&nbsp; She was sent
home in charge of a confidential servant of the establishment; and she,
too, died in the early summer of that year.&nbsp; Charlotte was thus
suddenly called into the responsibilities of eldest sister in a motherless
family.&nbsp; She remembered how anxiously her dear sister Maria had
striven, in her grave earnest way, to be a tender helper and a counsellor
to them all; and the duties that now fell upon her seemed almost like
a legacy from the gentle little sufferer so lately dead.</p>
<p>Both Charlotte and Emily returned to school after the Midsummer holidays
in this fatal year.&nbsp; But before the next winter it was thought
desirable to advise their removal, as it was evident that the damp situation
of the house at Cowan Bridge did not suit their health. <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>For the reason just stated, the little girls were sent home in the
autumn of 1825, when Charlotte was little more than nine years old.</p>
<p>About this time, an elderly woman of the village came to live as
servant at the parsonage.&nbsp; She remained there, as a member of the
household, for thirty years; and from the length of her faithful service,
and the attachment and respect which she inspired, is deserving of mention.&nbsp;
Tabby was a thorough specimen of a Yorkshire woman of her class, in
dialect, in appearance, and in character.&nbsp; She abounded in strong
practical sense and shrewdness.&nbsp; Her words were far from flattery;
but she would spare no deeds in the cause of those whom she kindly regarded.&nbsp;
She ruled the children pretty sharply; and yet never grudged a little
extra trouble to provide them with such small treats as came within
her power.&nbsp; In return, she claimed to be looked upon as a humble
friend; and, many years later, Miss Bront&euml; told me that she found
it somewhat difficult to manage, as Tabby expected to be informed of
all the family concerns, and yet had grown so deaf that what was repeated
to her became known to whoever might be in or about the house.&nbsp;
To obviate this publication of what it might be desirable to keep secret,
Miss Bront&euml; used to take her out for a walk on the solitary moors;
where, when both were seated on a tuft of heather, in some high lonely
place, she could acquaint the old woman, at leisure, with all that she
wanted to hear.</p>
<p>Tabby had lived in Haworth in the days when the pack-horses went
through once a week, with their tinkling bells and gay worsted adornment,
carrying the produce of the country from Keighley over the hills to
Colne and Burnley.&nbsp; What is more, she had known the &ldquo;bottom,&rdquo;
or valley, in those primitive days when the fairies frequented the margin
of the &ldquo;beck&rdquo; on moonlight nights, and had known folk who
had seen them.&nbsp; But that was when there were no mills in the valleys;
and when all the wool-spinning was done by hand in the farm-houses round.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It wur the factories as had driven &lsquo;em away,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; No doubt she had many a tale to tell of by-gone days of
the country-side; old ways of living, former inhabitants, decayed gentry,
who had melted away, and whose places knew them no more; family tragedies,
and dark superstitious dooms; and in telling these things, without the
least consciousness that there might ever be anything requiring to be
softened down, would give at full length the bare and simple details.</p>
<p>Miss Branwell instructed the children at regular hours in all she
could teach, making her bed-chamber into their schoolroom.&nbsp; Their
father was in the habit of relating to them any public news in which
he felt an interest; and from the opinions of his strong and independent
mind they would gather much food for thought; but I do not know whether
he gave them any direct instruction.&nbsp; Charlotte&rsquo;s deep thoughtful
spirit appears to have felt almost painfully the tender responsibility
which rested upon her with reference to her remaining sisters.&nbsp;
She was only eighteen months older than Emily; but Emily and Anne were
simply companions and playmates, while Charlotte was motherly friend
and guardian to both; and this loving assumption of duties beyond her
years, made her feel considerably older than she really was.</p>
<p>Patrick Branwell, their only brother, was a boy of remarkable promise,
and, in some ways, of extraordinary precocity of talent.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
friends advised him to send his son to school; but, remembering both
the strength of will of his own youth and his mode of employing it,
he believed that Patrick was better at home, and that he himself could
teach him well, as he had taught others before.&nbsp; So Patrick, or
as his family called him&mdash;Branwell, remained at Haworth, working
hard for some hours a day with his father; but, when the time of the
latter was taken up with his parochial duties, the boy was thrown into
chance companionship with the lads of the village&mdash;for youth will
to youth, and boys will to boys.</p>
<p>Still, he was associated in many of his sisters&rsquo; plays and
amusements.&nbsp; These were mostly of a sedentary and intellectual
nature.&nbsp; I have had a curious packet confided to me, containing
an immense amount of manuscript, in an inconceivably small space; tales,
dramas, poems, romances, written principally by Charlotte, in a hand
which it is almost impossible to decipher without the aid of a magnifying
glass.&nbsp; No description will give so good an idea of the extreme
minuteness of the writing as the annexed facsimile of a page.</p>
<p>Among these papers there is a list of her works, which I copy, as
a curious proof how early the rage for literary composition had seized
upon her:&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As each volume contains from sixty to a hundred pages, and the size
of the page lithographed is rather less than the average, the amount
of the whole seems very great, if we remember that it was all written
in about fifteen months.&nbsp; So much for the quantity; the quality
strikes me as of singular merit for a girl of thirteen or fourteen.&nbsp;
Both as a specimen of her prose style at this time, and also as revealing
something of the quiet domestic life led by these children, I take an
extract from the introduction to &ldquo;Tales of the Islanders,&rdquo;
the title of one of their &ldquo;Little Magazines:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June the 31st, 1829.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The play of the &lsquo;Islanders&rsquo; was formed in December,
1827, in the following manner.&nbsp; One night, about the time when
the cold sleet and stormy fogs of November are succeeded by the snow-storms,
and high piercing night winds of confirmed winter, we were all sitting
round the warm blazing kitchen fire, having just concluded a quarrel
with Tabby concerning the propriety of lighting a candle, from which
she came off victorious, no candle having been produced.&nbsp; A long
pause succeeded, which was at last broken by Branwell saying, in a lazy
manner, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was
echoed by Emily and Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tabby</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wha ya may go t&rsquo; bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Branwell</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather do anything
than that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Charlotte</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why are you so glum to-night,
Tabby?&nbsp; Oh! suppose we had each an island of our own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Branwell</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we had I would choose the
Island of Man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Charlotte</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I would choose the Isle
of Wight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Emily</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Isle of Arran for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Anne</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;And mine shall be Guernsey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We then chose who should be chief men in our islands.&nbsp;
Branwell chose John Bull, Astley Cooper, and Leigh Hunt; Emily, Walter
Scott, Mr. Lockhart, Johnny Lockhart; Anne, Michael Sadler, Lord Bentinck,
Sir Henry Halford.&nbsp; I chose the Duke of Wellington and two sons,
Christopher North and Co., and Mr. Abernethy.&nbsp; Here our conversation
was interrupted by the, to us, dismal sound of the clock striking seven,
and we were summoned off to bed.&nbsp; The next day we added many others
to our list of men, till we got almost all the chief men of the kingdom.&nbsp;
After this, for a long time, nothing worth noticing occurred.&nbsp;
In June, 1828, we erected a school on a fictitious island, which was
to contain 1,000 children.&nbsp; The manner of the building was as follows.&nbsp;
The Island was fifty miles in circumference, and certainly appeared
more like the work of enchantment than anything real,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two or three things strike me much in this fragment; one is the graphic
vividness with which the time of the year, the hour of the evening,
the feeling of cold and darkness outside, the sound of the night-winds
sweeping over the desolate snow-covered moors, coming nearer and nearer,
and at last shaking the very door of the room where they were sitting&mdash;for
it opened out directly on that bleak, wide expanse&mdash;is contrasted
with the glow, and busy brightness of the cheerful kitchen where these
remarkable children are grouped.&nbsp; Tabby moves about in her quaint
country-dress, frugal, peremptory, prone to find fault pretty sharply,
yet allowing no one else to blame her children, we may feel sure.&nbsp;
Another noticeable fact is the intelligent partisanship with which they
choose their great men, who are almost all stanch Tories of the time.&nbsp;
Moreover, they do not confine themselves to local heroes; their range
of choice has been widened by hearing much of what is not usually considered
to interest children.&nbsp; Little Anne, aged scarcely eight, picks
out the politicians of the day for her chief men.</p>
<p>There is another scrap of paper, in this all but illegible handwriting,
written about this time, and which gives some idea of the sources of
their opinions.</p>
<h3>THE HISTORY OF THE YEAR 1829.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Once Papa lent my sister Maria a book.&nbsp; It was an old
geography-book; she wrote on its blank leaf, &lsquo;Papa lent me this
book.&rsquo;&nbsp; This book is a hundred and twenty years old; it is
at this moment lying before me.&nbsp; While I write this I am in the
kitchen of the Parsonage, Haworth; Tabby, the servant, is washing up
the breakfast-things, and Anne, my youngest sister (Maria was my eldest),
is kneeling on a chair, looking at some cakes which Tabby has been baking
for us.&nbsp; Emily is in the parlour, brushing the carpet.&nbsp; Papa
and Branwell are gone to Keighley.&nbsp; Aunt is upstairs in her room,
and I am sitting by the table writing this in the kitchen.&nbsp; Keighley
is a small town four miles from here.&nbsp; Papa and Branwell are gone
for the newspaper, the &lsquo;Leeds Intelligencer,&rsquo; a most excellent
Tory newspaper, edited by Mr. Wood, and the proprietor, Mr. Henneman.&nbsp;
We take two and see three newspapers a week.&nbsp; We take the &lsquo;Leeds
Intelligencer,&rsquo; Tory, and the &lsquo;Leeds Mercury,&rsquo; Whig,
edited by Mr. Baines, and his brother, son-in-law, and his two sons,
Edward and Talbot.&nbsp; We see the &lsquo;John Bull;&rsquo; it is a
high Tory, very violent.&nbsp; Mr. Driver lends us it, as likewise &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rsquo; the most able periodical there is.&nbsp; The Editor
is Mr. Christopher North, an old man seventy-four years of age; the
1st of April is his birth-day; his company are Timothy Tickler, Morgan
O&rsquo;Doherty, Macrabin Mordecai, Mullion, Warnell, and James Hogg,
a man of most extraordinary genius, a Scottish shepherd.&nbsp; Our plays
were established; &lsquo;Young Men,&rsquo; June, 1826; &lsquo;Our Fellows,&rsquo;
July, 1827; &lsquo;Islanders,&rsquo; December, 1827.&nbsp; These are
our three great plays, that are not kept secret.&nbsp; Emily&rsquo;s
and my best plays were established the 1st of December, 1827; the others
March, 1828.&nbsp; Best plays mean secret plays; they are very nice
ones.&nbsp; All our plays are very strange ones.&nbsp; Their nature
I need not write on paper, for I think I shall always remember them.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;Young Men&rsquo;s&rsquo; play took its rise from some wooden
soldiers Branwell had: &lsquo;Our Fellows&rsquo; from &lsquo;&AElig;sop&rsquo;s
Fables;&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Islanders&rsquo; from several events which
happened.&nbsp; I will sketch out the origin of our plays more explicitly
if I can.&nbsp; First, &lsquo;Young Men.&rsquo;&nbsp; Papa bought Branwell
some wooden soldiers at Leeds; when Papa came home it was night, and
we were in bed, so next morning Branwell came to our door with a box
of soldiers.&nbsp; Emily and I jumped out of bed, and I snatched up
one and exclaimed, &lsquo;This is the Duke of Wellington!&nbsp; This
shall be the Duke!&rsquo;&nbsp; When I had said this, Emily likewise
took up one and said it should be hers; when Anne came down, she said
one should be hers.&nbsp; Mine was the prettiest of the whole, and the
tallest, and the most perfect in every part.&nbsp; Emily&rsquo;s was
a grave-looking fellow, and we called him &lsquo;Gravey.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Anne&rsquo;s was a queer little thing, much like herself, and we called
him &lsquo;Waiting-Boy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Branwell chose his, and called
him &lsquo;Buonaparte.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing extract shows something of the kind of reading in which
the little Bront&euml;s were interested; but their desire for knowledge
must have been excited in many directions, for I find a &ldquo;list
of painters whose works I wish to see,&rdquo; drawn up by Charlotte
when she was scarcely thirteen:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guido Reni, Julio Romano, Titian, Raphael, Michael Angelo,
Correggio, Annibal Caracci, Leonardo da Vinci, Fra Bartolomeo, Carlo
Cignani, Vandyke, Rubens, Bartolomeo Ramerghi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is this little girl, in a remote Yorkshire parsonage, who has
probably never seen anything worthy the name of a painting in her life,
studying the names and characteristics of the great old Italian and
Flemish masters, whose works she longs to see some time, in the dim
future that lies before her!&nbsp; There is a paper remaining which
contains minute studies of, and criticisms upon, the engravings in &ldquo;Friendship&rsquo;s
Offering for 1829;&rdquo; showing how she had early formed those habits
of close observation, and patient analysis of cause and effect, which
served so well in after-life as handmaids to her genius.</p>
<p>The way in which Mr. Bront&euml; made his children sympathise with
him in his great interest in politics, must have done much to lift them
above the chances of their minds being limited or tainted by petty local
gossip.&nbsp; I take the only other remaining personal fragment out
of &ldquo;Tales of the Islanders;&rdquo; it is a sort of apology, contained
in the introduction to the second volume, for their not having been
continued before; the writers had been for a long time too busy, and
latterly too much absorbed in politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parliament was opened, and the great Catholic question was
brought forward, and the Duke&rsquo;s measures were disclosed, and all
was slander, violence, party-spirit, and confusion.&nbsp; Oh, those
six months, from the time of the King&rsquo;s speech to the end!&nbsp;
Nobody could write, think, or speak on any subject but the Catholic
question, and the Duke of Wellington, and Mr. Peel.&nbsp; I remember
the day when the Intelligence Extraordinary came with Mr. Peel&rsquo;s
speech in it, containing the terms on which the Catholics were to be
let in!&nbsp; With what eagerness Papa tore off the cover, and how we
all gathered round him, and with what breathless anxiety we listened,
as one by one they were disclosed, and explained, and argued upon so
ably, and so well! and then when it was all out, how aunt said that
she thought it was excellent, and that the Catholics could do no harm
with such good security!&nbsp; I remember also the doubts as to whether
it would pass the House of Lords, and the prophecies that it would not;
and when the paper came which was to decide the question, the anxiety
was almost dreadful with which we listened to the whole affair: the
opening of the doors; the hush; the royal dukes in their robes, and
the great duke in green sash and waistcoat; the rising of all the peeresses
when he rose; the reading of his speech&mdash;Papa saying that his words
were like precious gold; and lastly, the majority of one to four (sic)
in favour of the Bill.&nbsp; But this is a digression,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>This must have been written when she was between thirteen and fourteen.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to some of my readers to know what was the
character of her purely imaginative writing at this period.&nbsp; While
her description of any real occurrence is, as we have seen, homely,
graphic, and forcible, when she gives way to her powers of creation,
her fancy and her language alike run riot, sometimes to the very borders
of apparent delirium.&nbsp; Of this wild weird writing, a single example
will suffice.&nbsp; It is a letter to the editor of one of the &ldquo;Little
Magazines.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;It is well known that the Genii have
declared that unless they perform certain arduous duties every year,
of a mysterious nature, all the worlds in the firmament will be burnt
up, and gathered together in one mighty globe, which will roll in solitary
grandeur through the vast wilderness of space, inhabited only by the
four high princes of the Genii, till time shall be succeeded by Eternity;
and the impudence of this is only to be paralleled by another of their
assertions, namely, that by their magic might they can reduce the world
to a desert, the purest waters to streams of livid poison, and the clearest
lakes to stagnant waters, the pestilential vapours of which shall slay
all living creatures, except the blood-thirsty beast of the forest,
and the ravenous bird of the rock.&nbsp; But that in the midst of this
desolation the palace of the Chief Genii shall rise sparkling in the
wilderness, and the horrible howl of their war-cry shall spread over
the land at morning, at noontide and night; but that they shall have
their annual feast over the bones of the dead, and shall yearly rejoice
with the joy of victors.&nbsp; I think, sir, that the horrible wickedness
of this needs no remark, and therefore I haste to subscribe myself,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;July 14, 1829.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not unlikely that the foregoing letter may have had some allegorical
or political reference, invisible to our eyes, but very clear to the
bright little minds for whom it was intended.&nbsp; Politics were evidently
their grand interest; the Duke of Wellington their demi-god.&nbsp; All
that related to him belonged to the heroic age.&nbsp; Did Charlotte
want a knight-errant, or a devoted lover, the Marquis of Douro, or Lord
Charles Wellesley, came ready to her hand.&nbsp; There is hardly one
of her prose-writings at this time in which they are not the principal
personages, and in which their &ldquo;august father&rdquo; does not
appear as a sort of Jupiter Tonans, or Deus ex Machin&acirc;.</p>
<p>As one evidence how Wellesley haunted her imagination, I copy out
a few of the titles to her papers in the various magazines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liffey Castle,&rdquo; a Tale by Lord C. Wellesley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lines to the River Aragua,&rdquo; by the Marquis of Douro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Extraordinary Dream,&rdquo; by Lord C. Wellesley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Green Dwarf, a Tale of the Perfect Tense,&rdquo; by the
Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange Events,&rdquo; by Lord C. A. F. Wellesley.</p>
<p>Life in an isolated village, or a lonely country-house, presents
many little occurrences which sink into the mind of childhood, there
to be brooded over.&nbsp; No other event may have happened, or be likely
to happen, for days, to push one of these aside, before it has assumed
a vague and mysterious importance.&nbsp; Thus, children leading a secluded
life are often thoughtful and dreamy: the impressions made upon them
by the world without&mdash;the unusual sights of earth and sky&mdash;the
accidental meetings with strange faces and figures (rare occurrences
in those out-of-the-way places)&mdash;are sometimes magnified by them
into things so deeply significant as to be almost supernatural.&nbsp;
This peculiarity I perceive very strongly in Charlotte&rsquo;s writings
at this time.&nbsp; Indeed, under the circumstances, it is no peculiarity.&nbsp;
It has been common to all, from the Chaldean shepherds&mdash;&ldquo;the
lonely herdsman stretched on the soft grass through half a summer&rsquo;s
day&rdquo;&mdash;the solitary monk&mdash;to all whose impressions from
without have had time to grow and vivify in the imagination, till they
have been received as actual personifications, or supernatural visions,
to doubt which would be blasphemy.</p>
<p>To counterbalance this tendency in Charlotte, was the strong common
sense natural to her, and daily called into exercise by the requirements
of her practical life.&nbsp; Her duties were not merely to learn her
lessons, to read a certain quantity, to gain certain ideas; she had,
besides, to brush rooms, to run errands up and down stairs, to help
in the simpler forms of cooking, to be by turns play-fellow and monitress
to her younger sisters and brother, to make and to mend, and to study
economy under her careful aunt.&nbsp; Thus we see that, while her imagination
received vivid impressions, her excellent understanding had full power
to rectify them before her fancies became realities.&nbsp; On a scrap
of paper, she has written down the following relation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 22, 1830, 6 o&rsquo;clock p.m.<br />
&ldquo;Haworth, near Bradford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following strange occurrence happened on the 22nd of June,
1830:&mdash;At the time Papa was very ill, confined to his bed, and
so weak that he could not rise without assistance.&nbsp; Tabby and I
were alone in the kitchen, about half-past nine ante-meridian.&nbsp;
Suddenly we heard a knock at the door; Tabby rose and opened it.&nbsp;
An old man appeared, standing without, who accosted her thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Old Man</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Does the parson live here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tabby</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Old Man</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;I wish to see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tabby</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;He is poorly in bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Old Man</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;I have a message for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tabby</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Who from?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Old Man</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;From the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tabby</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Old Man</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;The Lord.&nbsp; He desires me
to say that the Bridegroom is coming, and that we must prepare to meet
him; that the cords are about to be loosed, and the golden bowl broken;
the pitcher broken at the fountain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he concluded his discourse, and abruptly went his way.&nbsp;
As Tabby closed the door, I asked her if she knew him.&nbsp; Her reply
was, that she had never seen him before, nor any one like him.&nbsp;
Though I am fully persuaded that he was some fanatical enthusiast, well
meaning perhaps, but utterly ignorant of true piety; yet I could not
forbear weeping at his words, spoken so unexpectedly at that particular
period.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the date of the following poem is a little uncertain, it may
be most convenient to introduce it here.&nbsp; It must have been written
before 1833, but how much earlier there are no means of determining.&nbsp;
I give it as a specimen of the remarkable poetical talent shown in the
various diminutive writings of this time; at least, in all of them which
I have been able to read.</p>
<h3>THE WOUNDED STAG.</h3>
<p>Passing amid the deepest shade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the wood&rsquo;s sombre heart,<br />
Last night I saw a wounded deer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid lonely and apart.</p>
<p>Such light as pierced the crowded boughs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Light scattered, scant and dim,)<br />
Passed through the fern that formed his couch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And centred full on him.</p>
<p>Pain trembled in his weary limbs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain filled his patient eye,<br />
Pain-crushed amid the shadowy fern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His branchy crown did lie.</p>
<p>Where were his comrades? where his mate?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All from his death-bed gone!<br />
And he, thus struck and desolate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffered and bled alone.</p>
<p>Did he feel what a man might feel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Friend-left, and sore distrest?<br />
Did Pain&rsquo;s keen dart, and Grief&rsquo;s sharp sting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strive in his mangled breast?</p>
<p>Did longing for affection lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Barb every deadly dart;<br />
Love unrepaid, and Faith betrayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did these torment his heart?</p>
<p>No! leave to man his proper doom!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the pangs that rise<br />
Around the bed of state and gloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Adam&rsquo;s offspring dies!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>This is perhaps a fitting time to give some personal description
of Miss Bront&euml;.&nbsp; In 1831, she was a quiet, thoughtful girl,
of nearly fifteen years of age, very small in figure&mdash;&ldquo;stunted&rdquo;
was the word she applied to herself,&mdash;but as her limbs and head
were in just proportion to the slight, fragile body, no word in ever
so slight a degree suggestive of deformity could properly be applied
to her; with soft, thick, brown hair, and peculiar eyes, of which I
find it difficult to give a description, as they appeared to me in her
later life.&nbsp; They were large and well shaped; their colour a reddish
brown; but if the iris was closely examined, it appeared to be composed
of a great variety of tints.&nbsp; The usual expression was of quiet,
listening intelligence; but now and then, on some just occasion for
vivid interest or wholesome indignation, a light would shine out, as
if some spiritual lamp had been kindled, which glowed behind those expressive
orbs.&nbsp; I never saw the like in any other human creature.&nbsp;
As for the rest of her features, they were plain, large, and ill set;
but, unless you began to catalogue them, you were hardly aware of the
fact, for the eyes and power of the countenance over-balanced every
physical defect; the crooked mouth and the large nose were forgotten,
and the whole face arrested the attention, and presently attracted all
those whom she herself would have cared to attract.&nbsp; Her hands
and feet were the smallest I ever saw; when one of the former was placed
in mine, it was like the soft touch of a bird in the middle of my palm.&nbsp;
The delicate long fingers had a peculiar fineness of sensation, which
was one reason why all her handiwork, of whatever kind&mdash;writing,
sewing, knitting&mdash;was so clear in its minuteness.&nbsp; She was
remarkably neat in her whole personal attire; but she was dainty as
to the fit of her shoes and gloves.</p>
<p>I can well imagine that the grave serious composure, which, when
I knew her, gave her face the dignity of an old Venetian portrait, was
no acquisition of later years, but dated from that early age when she
found herself in the position of an elder sister to motherless children.&nbsp;
But in a girl only just entered on her teens, such an expression would
be called (to use a country phrase) &ldquo;old-fashioned;&rdquo; and
in 1831, the period of which I now write, we must think of her as a
little, set, antiquated girl, very quiet in manners, and very quaint
in dress; for besides the influence exerted by her father&rsquo;s ideas
concerning the simplicity of attire befitting the wife and daughters
of a country clergyman, her aunt, on whom the duty of dressing her nieces
principally devolved, had never been in society since she left Penzance,
eight or nine years before, and the Penzance fashions of that day were
still dear to her heart.</p>
<p>In January, 1831, Charlotte was sent to school again.&nbsp; This
time she went as a pupil to Miss W---, who lived at Roe Head, a cheerful
roomy country house, standing a little apart in a field, on the right
of the road from Leeds to Huddersfield.&nbsp; Three tiers of old-fashioned
semicircular bow windows run from basement to roof; and look down upon
a long green slope of pasture-land, ending in the pleasant woods of
Kirklees, Sir George Armitage&rsquo;s park.&nbsp; Although Roe Head
and Haworth are not twenty miles apart, the aspect of the country is
as totally dissimilar as if they enjoyed a different climate.&nbsp;
The soft curving and heaving landscape round the former gives a stranger
the idea of cheerful airiness on the heights, and of sunny warmth in
the broad green valleys below.&nbsp; It is just such a neighbourhood
as the monks loved, and traces of the old Plantagenet times are to be
met with everywhere, side by side with the manufacturing interests of
the West Riding of to-day.&nbsp; There is the park of Kirklees, full
of sunny glades, speckled with black shadows of immemorial yew-trees;
the grey pile of building, formerly a &ldquo;House of professed Ladies;&rdquo;
the mouldering stone in the depth of the wood, under which Robin Hood
is said to lie; close outside the park, an old stone-gabled house, now
a roadside inn, but which bears the name of the &ldquo;Three Nuns,&rdquo;
and has a pictured sign to correspond.&nbsp; And this quaint old inn
is frequented by fustian-dressed mill-hands from the neighbouring worsted
factories, which strew the high road from Leeds to Huddersfield, and
form the centres round which future villages gather.&nbsp; Such are
the contrasts of modes of living, and of times and seasons, brought
before the traveller on the great roads that traverse the West Riding.&nbsp;
In no other part of England, I fancy, are the centuries brought into
such close, strange contact as in the district in which Roe Head is
situated.&nbsp; Within six miles of Miss W---&rsquo;s house&mdash;on
the left of the road, coming from Leeds&mdash;lie the remains of Howley
Hall, now the property of Lord Cardigan, but formerly belonging to a
branch of the Saviles.&nbsp; Near to it is Lady Anne&rsquo;s well; &ldquo;Lady
Anne,&rdquo; according to tradition, having been worried and eaten by
wolves as she sat at the well, to which the indigo-dyed factory people
from Birstall and Batley woollen mills would formerly repair on Palm
Sunday, when the waters possess remarkable medicinal efficacy; and it
is still believed by some that they assume a strange variety of colours
at six o&rsquo;clock on the morning of that day.</p>
<p>All round the lands held by the farmer who lives in the remains of
Howley Hall are stone houses of to-day, occupied by the people who are
making their living and their fortunes by the woollen mills that encroach
upon and shoulder out the proprietors of the ancient halls.&nbsp; These
are to be seen in every direction, picturesque, many-gabled, with heavy
stone carvings of coats of arms for heraldic ornament; belonging to
decayed families, from whose ancestral lands field after field has been
shorn away, by the urgency of rich manufacturers pressing hard upon
necessity.</p>
<p>A smoky atmosphere surrounds these old dwellings of former Yorkshire
squires, and blights and blackens the ancient trees that overshadow
them; cinder-paths lead up to them; the ground round about is sold for
building upon; but still the neighbours, though they subsist by a different
state of things, remember that their forefathers lived in agricultural
dependence upon the owners of these halls; and treasure up the traditions
connected with the stately households that existed centuries ago.&nbsp;
Take Oakwell Hall, for instance.&nbsp; It stands in a pasture-field,
about a quarter of a mile from the high road.&nbsp; It is but that distance
from the busy whirr of the steam-engines employed in the woollen mills
at Birstall; and if you walk to it from Birstall Station about meal-time,
you encounter strings of mill-hands, blue with woollen dye, and cranching
in hungry haste over the cinder-paths bordering the high road.&nbsp;
Turning off from this to the right, you ascend through an old pasture-field,
and enter a short by-road, called the &ldquo;Bloody Lane&rdquo;&mdash;a
walk haunted by the ghost of a certain Captain Batt, the reprobate proprietor
of an old hall close by, in the days of the Stuarts.&nbsp; From the
&ldquo;Bloody Lane,&rdquo; overshadowed by trees, you come into the
field in which Oakwell Hall is situated.&nbsp; It is known in the neighbourhood
to be the place described as &ldquo;Field Head,&rdquo; Shirley&rsquo;s
residence.&nbsp; The enclosure in front, half court, half garden; the
panelled hall, with the gallery opening into the bed-chambers running
round; the barbarous peach-coloured drawing-room; the bright look-out
through the garden-door upon the grassy lawns and terraces behind, where
the soft-hued pigeons still love to coo and strut in the sun,&mdash;are
described in &ldquo;Shirley.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scenery of that fiction
lies close around; the real events which suggested it took place in
the immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p>They show a bloody footprint in a bed-chamber of Oakwell Hall, and
tell a story connected with it, and with the lane by which the house
is approached.&nbsp; Captain Batt was believed to be far away; his family
was at Oakwell; when in the dusk, one winter evening, he came stalking
along the lane, and through the hall, and up the stairs, into his own
room, where he vanished.&nbsp; He had been killed in a duel in London
that very same afternoon of December 9th, 1684.</p>
<p>The stones of the Hall formed part of the more ancient vicarage,
which an ancestor of Captain Batt&rsquo;s had seized in the troublous
times for property which succeeded the Reformation.&nbsp; This Henry
Batt possessed himself of houses and money without scruple; and, at
last, stole the great bell of Birstall Church, for which sacrilegious
theft a fine was imposed on the land, and has to be paid by the owner
of the Hall to this day.</p>
<p>But the Oakwell property passed out of the hands of the Batts at
the beginning of the last century; collateral descendants succeeded,
and left this picturesque trace of their having been.&nbsp; In the great
hall hangs a mighty pair of stag&rsquo;s horns, and dependent from them
a printed card, recording the fact that, on the 1st of September, 1763,
there was a great hunting-match, when this stag was slain; and that
fourteen gentlemen shared in the chase, and dined on the spoil in that
hall, along with Fairfax Fearneley, Esq., the owner.&nbsp; The fourteen
names are given, doubtless &ldquo;mighty men of yore;&rdquo; but, among
them all, Sir Fletcher Norton, Attorney-General, and Major-General Birch
were the only ones with which I had any association in 1855.&nbsp; Passing
on from Oakwell there lie houses right and left, which were well known
to Miss Bront&euml; when she lived at Roe Head, as the hospitable homes
of some of her school-fellows.&nbsp; Lanes branch off for three or four
miles to heaths and commons on the higher ground, which formed pleasant
walks on holidays, and then comes the white gate into the field-path
leading to Roe Head itself.</p>
<p>One of the bow-windowed rooms on the ground floor with the pleasant
look-out I have described was the drawing-room; the other was the schoolroom.&nbsp;
The dining-room was on one side of the door, and faced the road.</p>
<p>The number of pupils, during the year and a half Miss Bront&euml;
was there, ranged from seven to ten; and as they did not require the
whole of the house for their accommodation, the third story was unoccupied,
except by the ghostly idea of a lady, whose rustling silk gown was sometimes
heard by the listeners at the foot of the second flight of stairs.</p>
<p>The kind motherly nature of Miss W---, and the small number of the
girls, made the establishment more like a private family than a school.&nbsp;
Moreover, she was a native of the district immediately surrounding Roe
Head, as were the majority of her pupils.&nbsp; Most likely Charlotte
Bront&euml;, in coming from Haworth, came the greatest distance of all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;E.&rsquo;s&rdquo; home was five miles away; two other dear friends
(the Rose and Jessie Yorke of &ldquo;Shirley&rdquo;) lived still nearer;
two or three came from Huddersfield; one or two from Leeds.</p>
<p>I shall now quote from a valuable letter which I have received from
&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; one of these early friends; distinct and graphic
in expression, as becomes a cherished associate of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The time referred to is her first appearance at Roe Head, on January
19th, 1831.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first saw her coming out of a covered cart, in very old-fashioned
clothes, and looking very cold and miserable.&nbsp; She was coming to
school at Miss W---&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When she appeared in the schoolroom,
her dress was changed, but just as old.&nbsp; She looked a little old
woman, so short-sighted that she always appeared to be seeking something,
and moving her head from side to side to catch a sight of it.&nbsp;
She was very shy and nervous, and spoke with a strong Irish accent.&nbsp;
When a book was given her, she dropped her head over it till her nose
nearly touched it, and when she was told to hold her head up, up went
the book after it, still close to her nose, so that it was not possible
to help laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first impression she made upon one of those whose dear
and valued friend she was to become in after-life.&nbsp; Another of
the girls recalls her first sight of Charlotte, on the day she came,
standing by the schoolroom window, looking out on the snowy landscape,
and crying, while all the rest were at play.&nbsp; &ldquo;E.&rdquo;
was younger than she, and her tender heart was touched by the apparently
desolate condition in which she found the oddly-dressed, odd-looking
little girl that winter morning, as &ldquo;sick for home she stood in
tears,&rdquo; in a new strange place, among new strange people.&nbsp;
Any over-demonstrative kindness would have scared the wild little maiden
from Haworth; but &ldquo;E.&rdquo; (who is shadowed forth in the Caroline
Helstone of &ldquo;Shirley&rdquo;) managed to win confidence, and was
allowed to give sympathy.</p>
<p>To quote again from &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo; letter:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought her very ignorant, for she had never learnt grammar
at all, and very little geography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This account of her partial ignorance is confirmed by her other school-fellows.&nbsp;
But Miss W--- was a lady of remarkable intelligence and of delicate
tender sympathy.&nbsp; She gave a proof of this in her first treatment
of Charlotte.&nbsp; The little girl was well-read, but not well-grounded.&nbsp;
Miss W--- took her aside and told her she was afraid that she must place
her in the second class for some time till she could overtake the girls
of her own age in the knowledge of grammar, &amp;c.; but poor Charlotte
received this announcement with so sad a fit of crying, that Miss W---&rsquo;s
kind heart was softened, and she wisely perceived that, with such a
girl, it would be better to place her in the first class, and allow
her to make up by private study in those branches where she was deficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would confound us by knowing things that were out of our
range altogether.&nbsp; She was acquainted with most of the short pieces
of poetry that we had to learn by heart; would tell us the authors,
the poems they were taken from, and sometimes repeat a page or two,
and tell us the plot.&nbsp; She had a habit of writing in italics (printing
characters), and said she had learnt it by writing in their magazine.&nbsp;
They brought out a &lsquo;magazine&rsquo; once a month, and wished it
to look as like print as possible.&nbsp; She told us a tale out of it.&nbsp;
No one wrote in it, and no one read it, but herself, her brother, and
two sisters.&nbsp; She promised to show me some of these magazines,
but retracted it afterwards, and would never be persuaded to do so.&nbsp;
In our play hours she sate, or stood still, with a book, if possible.&nbsp;
Some of us once urged her to be on our side in a game at ball.&nbsp;
She said she had never played, and could not play.&nbsp; We made her
try, but soon found that she could not see the ball, so we put her out.&nbsp;
She took all our proceedings with pliable indifference, and always seemed
to need a previous resolution to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to anything.&nbsp;
She used to go and stand under the trees in the play-ground, and say
it was pleasanter.&nbsp; She endeavoured to explain this, pointing out
the shadows, the peeps of sky, &amp;c.&nbsp; We understood but little
of it.&nbsp; She said that at Cowan Bridge she used to stand in the
burn, on a stone, to watch the water flow by.&nbsp; I told her she should
have gone fishing; she said she never wanted.&nbsp; She always showed
physical feebleness in everything.&nbsp; She ate no animal food at school.&nbsp;
It was about this time I told her she was very ugly.&nbsp; Some years
afterwards, I told her I thought I had been very impertinent.&nbsp;
She replied, &lsquo;You did me a great deal of good, Polly, so don&rsquo;t
repent of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She used to draw much better, and more quickly,
than anything we had seen before, and knew much about celebrated pictures
and painters.&nbsp; Whenever an opportunity offered of examining a picture
or cut of any kind, she went over it piecemeal, with her eyes close
to the paper, looking so long that we used to ask her &lsquo;what she
saw in it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She could always see plenty, and explained it
very well.&nbsp; She made poetry and drawing at least exceedingly interesting
to me; and then I got the habit, which I have yet, of referring mentally
to her opinion on all matters of that kind, along with many more, resolving
to describe such and such things to her, until I start at the recollection
that I never shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To feel the full force of this last sentence&mdash;to show how steady
and vivid was the impression which Miss Bront&euml; made on those fitted
to appreciate her&mdash;I must mention that the writer of this letter,
dated January 18th, 1856, in which she thus speaks of constantly referring
to Charlotte&rsquo;s opinion has never seen her for eleven years, nearly
all of which have been passed among strange scenes, in a new continent,
at the antipodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used to be furious politicians, as one could hardly help
being in 1832.&nbsp; She knew the names of the two ministries; the one
that resigned, and the one that succeeded and passed the Reform Bill.&nbsp;
She worshipped the Duke of Wellington, but said that Sir Robert Peel
was not to be trusted; he did not act from principle like the rest,
but from expediency.&nbsp; I, being of the furious radical party, told
her &lsquo;how could any of them trust one another; they were all of
them rascals!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she would launch out into praises of
the Duke of Wellington, referring to his actions; which I could not
contradict, as I knew nothing about him.&nbsp; She said she had taken
interest in politics ever since she was five years old.&nbsp; She did
not get her opinions from her father&mdash;that is, not directly&mdash;but
from the papers, &amp;c., he preferred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In illustration of the truth of this, I may give an extract from
a letter to her brother, written from Roe Head, May 17th, 1832:&mdash;&ldquo;Lately
I had begun to think that I had lost all the interest which I used formerly
to take in politics; but the extreme pleasure I felt at the news of
the Reform Bill&rsquo;s being thrown out by the House of Lords, and
of the expulsion, or resignation of Earl Grey, &amp;c., convinced me
that I have not as yet lost all my penchant for politics.&nbsp; I am
extremely glad that aunt has consented to take in &lsquo;Fraser&rsquo;s
Magazine;&rsquo; for, though I know from your description of its general
contents it will be rather uninteresting when compared with &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo;
still it will be better than remaining the whole year without being
able to obtain a sight of any periodical whatever; and such would assuredly
be our case, as, in the little wild moorland village where we reside,
there would be no possibility of borrowing a work of that description
from a circulating library.&nbsp; I hope with you that the present delightful
weather may contribute to the perfect restoration of our dear papa&rsquo;s
health; and that it may give aunt pleasant reminiscences of the salubrious
climate of her native place,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>To return to &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo; letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to speak of her two elder sisters, Maria and Elizabeth,
who died at Cowan Bridge.&nbsp; I used to believe them to have been
wonders of talent and kindness.&nbsp; She told me, early one morning,
that she had just been dreaming; she had been told that she was wanted
in the drawing-room, and it was Maria and Elizabeth.&nbsp; I was eager
for her to go on, and when she said there was no more, I said, &lsquo;but
go on!&nbsp; <i>Make it out</i>!&nbsp; I know you can.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She said she would not; she wished she had not dreamed, for it did not
go on nicely, they were changed; they had forgotten what they used to
care for.&nbsp; They were very fashionably dressed, and began criticising
the room, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This habit of &lsquo;making out&rsquo; interests for themselves
that most children get who have none in actual life, was very strong
in her.&nbsp; The whole family used to &lsquo;make out&rsquo; histories,
and invent characters and events.&nbsp; I told her sometimes they were
like growing potatoes in a cellar.&nbsp; She said, sadly, &lsquo;Yes!&nbsp;
I know we are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one at school said she &lsquo;was always talking about
clever people; Johnson, Sheridan, &amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said, &lsquo;Now
you don&rsquo;t know the meaning of <i>clever</i>, Sheridan might be
clever; yes, Sheridan was clever,&mdash;scamps often are; but Johnson
hadn&rsquo;t a spark of cleverality in him.&rsquo;&nbsp; No one appreciated
the opinion; they made some trivial remark about &lsquo;<i>cleverality</i>,&rsquo;
and she said no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the epitome of her life.&nbsp; At our house she had
just as little chance of a patient hearing, for though not school-girlish,
we were more intolerant.&nbsp; We had a rage for practicality, and laughed
all poetry to scorn.&nbsp; Neither she nor we had any idea but that
our opinions were the opinions of all the <i>sensible</i> people in
the world, and we used to astonish each other at every sentence . .
. Charlotte, at school, had no plan of life beyond what circumstances
made for her.&nbsp; She knew that she must provide for herself, and
chose her trade; at least chose to begin it once.&nbsp; Her idea of
self-improvement ruled her even at school.&nbsp; It was to cultivate
her tastes.&nbsp; She always said there was enough of hard practicality
and <i>useful</i> knowledge forced on us by necessity, and that the
thing most needed was to soften and refine our minds.&nbsp; She picked
up every scrap of information concerning painting, sculpture, poetry,
music, &amp;c., as if it were gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I have heard of her school days from other sources, confirms
the accuracy of the details in this remarkable letter.&nbsp; She was
an indefatigable student: constantly reading and learning; with a strong
conviction of the necessity and value of education, very unusual in
a girl of fifteen.&nbsp; She never lost a moment of time, and seemed
almost to grudge the necessary leisure for relaxation and play-hours,
which might be partly accounted for by the awkwardness in all games
occasioned by her shortness of sight.&nbsp; Yet, in spite of these unsociable
habits, she was a great favourite with her school-fellows.&nbsp; She
was always ready to try and do what they wished, though not sorry when
they called her awkward, and left her out of their sports.&nbsp; Then,
at night, she was an invaluable story-teller, frightening them almost
out of their wits as they lay in bed.&nbsp; On one occasion the effect
was such that she was led to scream out aloud, and Miss W---, coming
up stairs, found that one of the listeners had been seized with violent
palpitations, in consequence of the excitement produced by Charlotte&rsquo;s
story.</p>
<p>Her indefatigable craving for knowledge tempted Miss W--- on into
setting her longer and longer tasks of reading for examination; and
towards the end of the year and a half that she remained as a pupil
at Roe Head, she received her first bad mark for an imperfect lesson.&nbsp;
She had had a great quantity of Blair&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lectures on Belles
Lettres&rdquo; to read; and she could not answer some of the questions
upon it; Charlotte Bront&euml; had a bad mark.&nbsp; Miss W--- was sorry,
and regretted that she had set Charlotte so long a task.&nbsp; Charlotte
cried bitterly.&nbsp; But her school-fellows were more than sorry&mdash;they
were indignant.&nbsp; They declared that the infliction of ever so slight
a punishment on Charlotte Bront&euml; was unjust&mdash;for who had tried
to do her duty like her?&mdash;and testified their feeling in a variety
of ways, until Miss W---, who was in reality only too willing to pass
over her good pupil&rsquo;s first fault, withdrew the bad mark; and
the girls all returned to their allegiance except &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo;
who took her own way during the week or two that remained of the half-year,
choosing to consider that Miss W---, in giving Charlotte Bront&euml;
so long a task, had forfeited her claim to obedience of the school regulations.</p>
<p>The number of pupils was so small that the attendance to certain
subjects at particular hours, common in larger schools, was not rigidly
enforced.&nbsp; When the girls were ready with their lessons, they came
to Miss W--- to say them.&nbsp; She had a remarkable knack of making
them feel interested in whatever they had to learn.&nbsp; They set to
their studies, not as to tasks or duties to be got through, but with
a healthy desire and thirst for knowledge, of which she had managed
to make them perceive the relishing savour.&nbsp; They did not leave
off reading and learning as soon as the compulsory pressure of school
was taken away.&nbsp; They had been taught to think, to analyse, to
reject, to appreciate.&nbsp; Charlotte Bront&euml; was happy in the
choice made for her of the second school to which she was sent.&nbsp;
There was a robust freedom in the out-of-doors life of her companions.&nbsp;
They played at merry games in the fields round the house: on Saturday
half-holidays they went long scrambling walks down mysterious shady
lanes, then climbing the uplands, and thus gaining extensive views over
the country, about which so much had to be told, both of its past and
present history.</p>
<p>Miss W--- must have had in great perfection the French art, &ldquo;conter,&rdquo;
to judge from her pupil&rsquo;s recollections of the tales she related
during these long walks, of this old house, or that new mill, and of
the states of society consequent on the changes involved by the suggestive
dates of either building.&nbsp; She remembered the times when watchers
or wakeners in the night heard the distant word of command, and the
measured tramp of thousands of sad desperate men receiving a surreptitious
military training, in preparation for some great day which they saw
in their visions, when right should struggle with might and come off
victorious: when the people of England, represented by the workers of
Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Nottinghamshire, should make their voice
heard in a terrible slogan, since their true and pitiful complaints
could find no hearing in parliament.&nbsp; We forget, now-a-days, so
rapid have been the changes for the better, how cruel was the condition
of numbers of labourers at the close of the great Peninsular war.&nbsp;
The half-ludicrous nature of some of their grievances has lingered on
in tradition; the real intensity of their sufferings has become forgotten.&nbsp;
They were maddened and desperate; and the country, in the opinion of
many, seemed to be on the verge of a precipice, from which it was only
saved by the prompt and resolute decision of a few in authority.&nbsp;
Miss W--- spoke of those times; of the mysterious nightly drillings;
of thousands on lonely moors; of the muttered threats of individuals
too closely pressed upon by necessity to be prudent; of the overt acts,
in which the burning of Cartwright&rsquo;s mill took a prominent place;
and these things sank deep into the mind of one, at least, among her
hearers.</p>
<p>Mr. Cartwright was the owner of a factory called Rawfolds, in Liversedge,
not beyond the distance of a walk from Roe Head.&nbsp; He had dared
to employ machinery for the dressing of woollen cloth, which was an
unpopular measure in 1812, when many other circumstances conspired to
make the condition of the mill-hands unbearable from the pressure of
starvation and misery.&nbsp; Mr. Cartwright was a very remarkable man,
having, as I have been told, some foreign blood in him, the traces of
which were very apparent in his tall figure, dark eyes and complexion,
and singular, though gentlemanly bearing.&nbsp; At any rate he had been
much abroad, and spoke French well, of itself a suspicious circumstance
to the bigoted nationality of those days.&nbsp; Altogether he was an
unpopular man, even before he took the last step of employing shears,
instead of hands, to dress his wool.&nbsp; He was quite aware of his
unpopularity, and of the probable consequences.&nbsp; He had his mill
prepared for an assault.&nbsp; He took up his lodgings in it; and the
doors were strongly barricaded at night.&nbsp; On every step of the
stairs there was placed a roller, spiked with barbed points all round,
so as to impede the ascent of the rioters, if they succeeded in forcing
the doors.</p>
<p>On the night of Saturday the 11th of April, 1812, the assault was
made.&nbsp; Some hundreds of starving cloth-dressers assembled in the
very field near Kirklees that sloped down from the house which Miss
W--- afterwards inhabited, and were armed by their leaders with pistols,
hatchets, and bludgeons, many of which had been extorted by the nightly
bands that prowled about the country, from such inhabitants of lonely
houses as had provided themselves with these means of self-defence.&nbsp;
The silent sullen multitude marched in the dead of that spring-night
to Rawfolds, and giving tongue with a great shout, roused Mr. Cartwright
up to the knowledge that the long-expected attack was come.&nbsp; He
was within walls, it is true; but against the fury of hundreds he had
only four of his own workmen and five soldiers to assist him.&nbsp;
These ten men, however, managed to keep up such a vigorous and well-directed
fire of musketry that they defeated all the desperate attempts of the
multitude outside to break down the doors, and force a way into the
mill; and, after a conflict of twenty minutes, during which two of the
assailants were killed and several wounded, they withdrew in confusion,
leaving Mr. Cartwright master of the field, but so dizzy and exhausted,
now the peril was past, that he forgot the nature of his defences, and
injured his leg rather seriously by one of the spiked rollers, in attempting
to go up his own staircase.&nbsp; His dwelling was near the factory.&nbsp;
Some of the rioters vowed that, if he did not give in, they would leave
this, and go to his house, and murder his wife and children.&nbsp; This
was a terrible threat, for he had been obliged to leave his family with
only one or two soldiers to defend them.&nbsp; Mrs. Cartwright knew
what they had threatened; and on that dreadful night, hearing, as she
thought, steps approaching, she snatched up her two infant children,
and put them in a basket up the great chimney, common in old-fashioned
Yorkshire houses.&nbsp; One of the two children who had been thus stowed
away used to point out with pride, after she had grown up to woman&rsquo;s
estate, the marks of musket shot, and the traces of gunpowder on the
walls of her father&rsquo;s mill.&nbsp; He was the first that had offered
any resistance to the progress of the &ldquo;Luddites,&rdquo; who had
become by this time so numerous as almost to assume the character of
an insurrectionary army.&nbsp; Mr. Cartwright&rsquo;s conduct was so
much admired by the neighbouring mill-owners that they entered into
a subscription for his benefit which amounted in the end to 3,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Not much more than a fortnight after this attack on Rawfolds, another
manufacturer who employed the obnoxious machinery was shot down in broad
daylight, as he was passing over Crossland Moor, which was skirted by
a small plantation in which the murderers lay hidden.&nbsp; The readers
of &ldquo;Shirley&rdquo; will recognise these circumstances, which were
related to Miss Bront&euml; years after they occurred, but on the very
spots where they took place, and by persons who remembered full well
those terrible times of insecurity to life and property on the one hand,
and of bitter starvation and blind ignorant despair on the other.</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; himself had been living amongst these very people
in 1812, as he was then clergyman at Hartshead, not three miles from
Rawfolds; and, as I have mentioned, it was in these perilous times that
he began his custom of carrying a loaded pistol continually about with
him.&nbsp; For not only his Tory politics, but his love and regard for
the authority of the law, made him despise the cowardice of the surrounding
magistrates, who, in their dread of the Luddites, refused to interfere
so as to prevent the destruction of property.&nbsp; The clergy of the
district were the bravest men by far.</p>
<p>There was a Mr. Roberson of Heald&rsquo;s Hall, a friend of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
who has left a deep impression of himself on the public mind.&nbsp;
He lived near Heckmondwike, a large, straggling, dirty village, not
two miles from Roe Head.&nbsp; It was principally inhabited by blanket
weavers, who worked in their own cottages; and Heald&rsquo;s Hall is
the largest house in the village, of which Mr. Roberson was the vicar.&nbsp;
At his own cost, he built a handsome church at Liversedge, on a hill
opposite the one on which his house stood, which was the first attempt
in the West Riding to meet the wants of the overgrown population, and
made many personal sacrifices for his opinions, both religious and political,
which were of the true old-fashioned Tory stamp.&nbsp; He hated everything
which he fancied had a tendency towards anarchy.&nbsp; He was loyal
in every fibre to Church and King; and would have proudly laid down
his life, any day, for what he believed to be right and true.&nbsp;
But he was a man of an imperial will, and by it he bore down opposition,
till tradition represents him as having something grimly demoniac about
him.&nbsp; He was intimate with Cartwright, and aware of the attack
likely to be made on his mill; accordingly, it is said, he armed himself
and his household, and was prepared to come to the rescue, in the event
of a signal being given that aid was needed.&nbsp; Thus far is likely
enough.&nbsp; Mr. Roberson had plenty of warlike spirit in him, man
of peace though he was.</p>
<p>But, in consequence of his having taken the unpopular side, exaggerations
of his character linger as truth in the minds of the people; and a fabulous
story is told of his forbidding any one to give water to the wounded
Luddites, left in the mill-yard, when he rode in the next morning to
congratulate his friend Cartwright on his successful defence.&nbsp;
Moreover, this stern, fearless clergyman had the soldiers that were
sent to defend the neighbourhood billeted at his house; and this deeply
displeased the workpeople, who were to be intimidated by the red-coats.&nbsp;
Although not a magistrate, he spared no pains to track out the Luddites
concerned in the assassination I have mentioned; and was so successful
in his acute unflinching energy, that it was believed he had been supernaturally
aided; and the country people, stealing into the fields surrounding
Heald&rsquo;s Hall on dusky winter evenings, years after this time,
declared that through the windows they saw Parson Roberson dancing,
in a strange red light, with black demons all whirling and eddying round
him.&nbsp; He kept a large boys&rsquo; school; and made himself both
respected and dreaded by his pupils.&nbsp; He added a grim kind of humour
to his strength of will; and the former quality suggested to his fancy
strange out-of-the-way kinds of punishment for any refractory pupils:
for instance, he made them stand on one leg in a corner of the schoolroom,
holding a heavy book in each hand; and once, when a boy had run away
home, he followed him on horseback, reclaimed him from his parents,
and, tying him by a rope to the stirrup of his saddle, made him run
alongside of his horse for the many miles they had to traverse before
reaching Heald&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>One other illustration of his character may be given.&nbsp; He discovered
that his servant Betty had &ldquo;a follower;&rdquo; and, watching his
time till Richard was found in the kitchen, he ordered him into the
dining-room, where the pupils were all assembled.&nbsp; He then questioned
Richard whether he had come after Betty; and on his confessing the truth,
Mr. Roberson gave the word, &ldquo;Off with him, lads, to the pump!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The poor lover was dragged to the court-yard, and the pump set to play
upon him; and, between every drenching, the question was put to him,
&ldquo;Will you promise not to come after Betty again?&rdquo;&nbsp;
For a long time Richard bravely refused to give in; when &ldquo;Pump
again, lads!&rdquo; was the order.&nbsp; But, at last, the poor soaked
&ldquo;follower&rdquo; was forced to yield, and renounce his Betty.</p>
<p>The Yorkshire character of Mr. Roberson would be incomplete if I
did not mention his fondness for horses.&nbsp; He lived to be a very
old man, dying some time nearer to 1840 than 1830; and even after he
was eighty years of age, he took great delight in breaking refractory
steeds; if necessary, he would sit motionless on their backs for half-an-hour
or more to bring them to.&nbsp; There is a story current that once,
in a passion, he shot his wife&rsquo;s favourite horse, and buried it
near a quarry, where the ground, some years after, miraculously opened
and displayed the skeleton; but the real fact is, that it was an act
of humanity to put a poor old horse out of misery; and that, to spare
it pain, he shot it with his own hands, and buried it where, the ground
sinking afterwards by the working of a coal-pit, the bones came to light.&nbsp;
The traditional colouring shows the animus with which his memory is
regarded by one set of people.&nbsp; By another, the neighbouring clergy,
who remember him riding, in his old age, down the hill on which his
house stood, upon his strong white horse&mdash;his bearing proud and
dignified, his shovel hat bent over and shadowing his keen eagle eyes&mdash;going
to his Sunday duty like a faithful soldier that dies in harness&mdash;who
can appreciate his loyalty to conscience, his sacrifices to duty, and
his stand by his religion&mdash;his memory is venerated.&nbsp; In his
extreme old age, a rubric meeting was held, at which his clerical brethren
gladly subscribed to present him with a testimonial of their deep respect
and regard.</p>
<p>This is a specimen of the strong character not seldom manifested
by the Yorkshire clergy of the Established Church.&nbsp; Mr. Roberson
was a friend of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s father; lived within a
couple of miles of Roe Head while she was at school there; and was deeply
engaged in transactions, the memory of which was yet recent when she
heard of them, and of the part which he had had in them.</p>
<p>I may now say a little on the character of the Dissenting population
immediately surrounding Roe Head; for the &ldquo;Tory and clergyman&rsquo;s
daughter,&rdquo; &ldquo;taking interest in politics ever since she was
five years old,&rdquo; and holding frequent discussions with such of
the girls as were Dissenters and Radicals, was sure to have made herself
as much acquainted as she could with the condition of those to whom
she was opposed in opinion.</p>
<p>The bulk of the population were Dissenters, principally Independents.&nbsp;
In the village of Heckmondwike, at one end of which Roe Head is situated,
there were two large chapels belonging to that denomination, and one
to the Methodists, all of which were well filled two or three times
on a Sunday, besides having various prayer-meetings, fully attended,
on week-days.&nbsp; The inhabitants were a chapel-going people, very
critical about the doctrine of their sermons, tyrannical to their ministers,
and violent Radicals in politics.&nbsp; A friend, well acquainted with
the place when Charlotte Bront&euml; was at school, has described some
events which occurred then among them:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scene, which took place at the Lower Chapel at Heckmondwike,
will give you some idea of the people at that time.&nbsp; When a newly-married
couple made their appearance at chapel, it was the custom to sing the
Wedding Anthem, just after the last prayer, and as the congregation
was quitting the chapel.&nbsp; The band of singers who performed this
ceremony expected to have money given them, and often passed the following
night in drinking; at least, so said the minister of the place; and
he determined to put an end to this custom.&nbsp; In this he was supported
by many members of the chapel and congregation; but so strong was the
democratic element, that he met with the most violent opposition, and
was often insulted when he went into the street.&nbsp; A bride was expected
to make her first appearance, and the minister told the singers not
to perform the anthem.&nbsp; On their declaring they would, he had the
large pew which they usually occupied locked; they broke it open: from
the pulpit he told the congregation that, instead of their singing a
hymn, he would read a chapter; hardly had he uttered the first word,
before up rose the singers, headed by a tall, fierce-looking weaver,
who gave out a hymn, and all sang it at the very top of their voices,
aided by those of their friends who were in the chapel.&nbsp; Those
who disapproved of the conduct of the singers, and sided with the minister,
remained seated till the hymn was finished.&nbsp; Then he gave out the
chapter again, read it, and preached.&nbsp; He was just about to conclude
with prayer, when up started the singers and screamed forth another
hymn.&nbsp; These disgraceful scenes were continued for many weeks,
and so violent was the feeling, that the different parties could hardly
keep from blows as they came through the chapel-yard.&nbsp; The minister,
at last, left the place, and along with him went many of the most temperate
and respectable part of the congregation, and the singers remained triumphant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that there was such a violent contest respecting
the choice of a pastor, about this time, in the Upper Chapel at Heckmondwike,
that the Riot Act had to be read at a church-meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly, the <i>soi-disant</i> Christians who forcibly ejected
Mr. Redhead at Haworth, ten or twelve years before, held a very heathen
brotherhood with the <i>soi-disant</i> Christians of Heckmondwike; though
the one set might be called members of the Church of England and the
other Dissenters.</p>
<p>The letter from which I have taken the above extract relates throughout
to the immediate neighbourhood of the place where Charlotte Bront&euml;
spent her school-days, and describes things as they existed at that
very time.&nbsp; The writer says,&mdash;&ldquo;Having been accustomed
to the respectful manners of the lower orders in the agricultural districts,
I was at first, much disgusted and somewhat alarmed at the great freedom
displayed by the working classes of Heckmondwike and Gomersall to those
in a station above them.&nbsp; The term &lsquo;lass,&rsquo; was as freely
applied to any young lady, as the word &lsquo;wench&rsquo; is in Lancashire.&nbsp;
The extremely untidy appearance of the villagers shocked me not a little,
though I must do the housewives the justice to say that the cottages
themselves were not dirty, and had an air of rough plenty about them
(except when trade was bad), that I had not been accustomed to see in
the farming districts.&nbsp; The heap of coals on one side of the house-door,
and the brewing tubs on the other, and the frequent perfume of malt
and hops as you walked along, proved that fire and &lsquo;home-brewed&rsquo;
were to be found at almost every man&rsquo;s hearth.&nbsp; Nor was hospitality,
one of the main virtues of Yorkshire, wanting.&nbsp; Oat-cake, cheese,
and beer were freely pressed upon the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There used to be a yearly festival, half-religious, half social,
held at Heckmondwike, called &lsquo;The Lecture.&rsquo;&nbsp; I fancy
it had come down from the times of the Nonconformists.&nbsp; A sermon
was preached by some stranger at the Lower Chapel, on a week-day evening,
and the next day, two sermons in succession were delivered at the Upper
Chapel.&nbsp; Of course, the service was a very long one, and as the
time was June, and the weather often hot, it used to be regarded by
myself and my companions as no pleasurable way of passing the morning.&nbsp;
The rest of the day was spent in social enjoyment; great numbers of
strangers flocked to the place; booths were erected for the sale of
toys and gingerbread (a sort of &lsquo;Holy Fair&rsquo;); and the cottages,
having had a little extra paint and white-washing, assumed quite a holiday
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The village of Gomersall&rdquo; (where Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
friend &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; lived with her family), &ldquo;which was a
much prettier place than Heckmondwike, contained a strange-looking cottage,
built of rough unhewn stones, many of them projecting considerably,
with uncouth heads and grinning faces carved upon them; and upon a stone
above the door was cut, in large letters, &lsquo;SPITE HALL.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was erected by a man in the village, opposite to the house of his
enemy, who had just finished for himself a good house, commanding a
beautiful view down the valley, which this hideous building quite shut
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearless&mdash;because this people were quite familiar to all of
them&mdash;amidst such a population, lived and walked the gentle Miss
W---&rsquo;s eight or nine pupils.&nbsp; She herself was born and bred
among this rough, strong, fierce set, and knew the depth of goodness
and loyalty that lay beneath their wild manners and insubordinate ways.&nbsp;
And the girls talked of the little world around them, as if it were
the only world that was; and had their opinions and their parties, and
their fierce discussions like their elders&mdash;possibly, their betters.&nbsp;
And among them, beloved and respected by all, laughed at occasionally
by a few, but always to her face&mdash;lived, for a year and a half,
the plain, short-sighted, oddly-dressed, studious little girl they called
Charlotte Bront&euml;.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Miss Bront&euml; left Roe Head in 1832, having won the affectionate
regard both of her teacher and her school-fellows, and having formed
there the two fast friendships which lasted her whole life long; the
one with &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; who has not kept her letters; the other
with &ldquo;E.,&rdquo; who has kindly entrusted me with a large portion
of Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s correspondence with her.&nbsp; This she
has been induced to do by her knowledge of the urgent desire on the
part of Mr. Bront&euml; that the life of his daughter should be written,
and in compliance with a request from her husband that I should be permitted
to have the use of these letters, without which such a task could be
but very imperfectly executed.&nbsp; In order to shield this friend,
however, from any blame or misconstruction, it is only right to state
that, before granting me this privilege, she throughout most carefully
and completely effaced the names of the persons and places which occurred
in them; and also that such information as I have obtained from her
bears reference solely to Miss Bront&euml; and her sisters, and not
to any other individuals whom I may find it necessary to allude to in
connection with them.</p>
<p>In looking over the earlier portion of this correspondence, I am
struck afresh by the absence of hope, which formed such a strong characteristic
in Charlotte.&nbsp; At an age when girls, in general, look forward to
an eternal duration of such feelings as they or their friends entertain,
and can therefore see no hindrance to the fulfilment of any engagements
dependent on the future state of the affections, she is surprised that
&ldquo;E.&rdquo; keeps her promise to write.&nbsp; In after-life, I
was painfully impressed with the fact, that Miss Bront&euml; never dared
to allow herself to look forward with hope; that she had no confidence
in the future; and I thought, when I heard of the sorrowful years she
had passed through, that it had been this this pressure of grief which
had crushed all buoyancy of expectation out of her.&nbsp; But it appears
from the letters, that it must have been, so to speak, constitutional;
or, perhaps, the deep pang of losing her two elder sisters combined
with a permanent state of bodily weakness in producing her hopelessness.&nbsp;
If her trust in God had been less strong, she would have given way to
unbounded anxiety, at many a period of her life.&nbsp; As it was, we
shall see, she made a great and successful effort to leave &ldquo;her
times in His hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her return home, she employed herself in teaching her sisters,
over whom she had had superior advantages.&nbsp; She writes thus, July
21st, 1832, of her course of life at the parsonage:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An account of one day is an account of all.&nbsp; In the morning,
from nine o&rsquo;clock till half-past twelve, I instruct my sisters,
and draw; then we walk till dinner-time.&nbsp; After dinner I sew till
tea-time, and after tea I either write, read, or do a little fancy-work,
or draw, as I please.&nbsp; Thus, in one delightful, though somewhat
monotonous course, my life is passed.&nbsp; I have been only out twice
to tea since I came home.&nbsp; We are expecting company this afternoon,
and on Tuesday next we shall have all the female teachers of the Sunday-school
to tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I may here introduce a quotation from a letter which I have received
from &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; since the publication of the previous editions
of this memoir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after leaving school she admitted reading something of
Cobbett&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &lsquo;She did not like him,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;but all was fish that came to her net.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this time
she wrote to me that reading and drawing were the only amusements she
had, and that her supply of books was very small in proportion to her
wants.&nbsp; She never spoke of her aunt.&nbsp; When I saw Miss Branwell
she was a very precise person, and looked very odd, because her dress,
&amp;c., was so utterly out of fashion.&nbsp; She corrected one of us
once for using the word &lsquo;spit&rsquo; or &lsquo;spitting.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She made a great favourite of Branwell.&nbsp; She made her nieces sew,
with purpose or without, and as far as possible discouraged any other
culture.&nbsp; She used to keep the girls sewing charity clothing, and
maintained to me that it was not for the good of the recipients, but
of the sewers.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was proper for them to do it,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; Charlotte never was &lsquo;in wild excitement&rsquo;
that I know of.&nbsp; When in health she used to talk better, and indeed
when in low spirits never spoke at all.&nbsp; She needed her best spirits
to say what was in her heart, for at other times she had not courage.&nbsp;
She never gave decided opinions at such times . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte said she could get on with any one who had a bump
at the top of their heads (meaning conscientiousness).&nbsp; I found
that I seldom differed from her, except that she was far too tolerant
of stupid people, if they had a grain of kindness in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about this time that Mr. Bront&euml; provided his children
with a teacher in drawing, who turned out to be a man of considerable
talent, but very little principle.&nbsp; Although they never attained
to anything like proficiency, they took great interest in acquiring
this art; evidently, from an instinctive desire to express their powerful
imaginations in visible forms.&nbsp; Charlotte told me, that at this
period of her life, drawing, and walking out with her sisters, formed
the two great pleasures and relaxations of her day.</p>
<p>The three girls used to walk upwards toward the &ldquo;purple-black&rdquo;
moors, the sweeping surface of which was broken by here and there a
stone-quarry; and if they had strength and time to go far enough, they
reached a waterfall, where the beck fell over some rocks into the &ldquo;bottom.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They seldom went downwards through the village.&nbsp; They were shy
of meeting even familiar faces, and were scrupulous about entering the
house of the very poorest uninvited. They were steady teachers at the
Sunday-School, a habit which Charlotte kept up very faithfully, even
after she was left alone; but they never faced their kind voluntary,
and always preferred the solitude and freedom of the moors.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In the September of this year, Charlotte went to pay her first visit
to her friend &ldquo;E.&rdquo;&nbsp; It took her into the neighbourhood
of Roe Head, and brought her into pleasant contact with many of her
old school-fellows.&nbsp; After this visit she and her friend seem to
have agreed to correspond in French, for the sake of improvement in
the language.&nbsp; But this improvement could not be great, when it
could only amount to a greater familiarity with dictionary words, and
when there was no one to explain to them that a verbal translation of
English idioms hardly constituted French composition; but the effort
was laudable, and of itself shows how willing they both were to carry
on the education which they had begun under Miss W-.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will
give an extract which, whatever may be thought of the language, is graphic
enough, and presents us with a happy little family picture; the eldest
sister returning home to the two younger, after a fortnight&rsquo;s
absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J&rsquo;arrivait &agrave; Haworth en parfaite sauvet&eacute;
sans le moindre accident ou malheur.&nbsp; Mes petites s&oelig;urs couraient
hors de la maison pour me rencontrer aussit&ocirc;t que la voiture se
fit voir, et elles m&rsquo;embrassaient avec autant d&rsquo;empressement
et de plaisir comme si j&rsquo;avais &eacute;t&eacute; absente pour
plus d&rsquo;an.&nbsp; Mon Papa, ma Tante, et le monsieur dent men fr&egrave;re
avoit parl&eacute;, furent tous assembl&eacute;s dans le Salon, et en
peu de temps je m&rsquo;y rendis aussi.&nbsp; C&rsquo;est souvent l&rsquo;ordre
du Ciel que quand on a perdu un plaisir il y en a un autre pr&ecirc;t
&agrave; prendre sa place.&nbsp; Ainsi je venois de partir de tr&egrave;s-chers
amis, mais tout &agrave; l&rsquo;heure je revins &agrave; des parens
aussi chers et bon dans le moment.&nbsp; M&ecirc;me que vous me perdiez
(ose-je croire que mon d&eacute;part vous &eacute;tait un chagrin?)
vous attendites l&rsquo;arriv&eacute;e de votre fr&egrave;re, et de
votre s&oelig;ur.&nbsp; J&rsquo;ai donn&eacute; &agrave; mes s&oelig;urs
les pommes que vous leur envoyiez avec tant de bont&eacute;; elles disent
qu&rsquo;elles sont s&ucirc;r que Mademoiselle E. est tr&egrave;s-aimable
et bonne; l&rsquo;une et l&rsquo;autre sont extr&ecirc;mement impatientes
de vous voir; j&rsquo;esp&egrave;re qu&rsquo;en peu de mois elles auront
ce plaisir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was some time yet before the friends could meet, and meanwhile
they agreed to correspond once a month.&nbsp; There were no events to
chronicle in the Haworth letters.&nbsp; Quiet days, occupied in reaching,
and feminine occupations in the house, did not present much to write
about; and Charlotte was naturally driven to criticise books.</p>
<p>Of these there were many in different plights, and according to their
plight, kept in different places.&nbsp; The well-bound were ranged in
the sanctuary of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s study; but the purchase of
books was a necessary luxury to him, but as it was often a choice between
binding an old one, or buying a new one, the familiar volume, which
had been hungrily read by all the members of the family, was sometimes
in such a condition that the bedroom shelf was considered its fitting
place.&nbsp; Up and down the house were to be found many standard works
of a solid kind.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s writings, Wordsworth&rsquo;s
and Southey&rsquo;s poems were among the lighter literature; while,
as having a character of their own&mdash;earnest, wild, and occasionally
fanatical&mdash;may be named some of the books which came from the Branwell
side of the family&mdash;from the Cornish followers of the saintly John
Wesley&mdash;and which are touched on in the account of the works to
which Caroline Helstone had access in &ldquo;Shirley:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Some
venerable Lady&rsquo;s Magazines, that had once performed a voyage with
their owner, and undergone a storm&rdquo;&mdash;(possibly part of the
relics of Mrs. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s possessions, contained in the ship
wrecked on the coast of Cornwall)&mdash;&ldquo;and whose pages were
stained with salt water; some mad Methodist Magazines full of miracles
and apparitions, and preternatural warnings, ominous dreams, and frenzied
fanaticisms; and the equally mad letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe from
the Dead to the Living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; encouraged a taste for reading in his girls; and
though Miss Branwell kept it in due bounds, by the variety of household
occupations, in which she expected them not merely to take a part, but
to become proficients, thereby occupying regularly a good portion of
every day, they were allowed to get books from the circulating library
at Keighley; and many a happy walk, up those long four miles, must they
have had, burdened with some new book, into which they peeped as they
hurried home.&nbsp; Not that the books were what would generally be
called new; in the beginning of 1833, the two friends seem almost simultaneously
to have fallen upon &ldquo;Kenilworth,&rdquo; and Charlotte writes as
follows about it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you like &lsquo;Kenilworth;&rsquo; it is certainly
more resembling a romance than a novel: in my opinion, one of the most
interesting works that ever emanated from the great Sir Walter&rsquo;s
pen.&nbsp; Varney is certainly the personification of consummate villainy;
and in the delineation of his dark and profoundly artful mind, Scott
exhibits a wonderful knowledge of human nature, as well as a surprising
skill in embodying his perceptions, so as to enable others to become
participators in that knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commonplace as this extract may seem, it is noteworthy on two or
three accounts: in the first place, instead of discussing the plot or
story, she analyses the character of Varney; and next, she, knowing
nothing of the world, both from her youth and her isolated position,
has yet been so accustomed to hear &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; distrusted,
as to receive the notion of intense and artful villainy without surprise.</p>
<p>What was formal and set in her way of writing to &ldquo;E.&rdquo;
diminished as their personal acquaintance increased, and as each came
to know the home of the other; so that small details concerning people
and places had their interest and their significance.&nbsp; In the summer
of 1833, she wrote to invite her friend to come and pay her a visit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Aunt thought it would be better&rdquo; (she says) &ldquo;to defer
it until about the middle of summer, as the winter, and even the spring
seasons, are remarkably cold and bleak among our mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first impression made on the visitor by the sisters of her school-friend
was, that Emily was a tall, long-armed girl, more fully grown than her
elder sister; extremely reserved in manner. I distinguish reserve from
shyness, because I imagine shyness would please, if it knew how; whereas,
reserve is indifferent whether it pleases or not.&nbsp; Anne, like her
eldest sister, was shy; Emily was reserved.</p>
<p>Branwell was rather a handsome boy, with &ldquo;tawny&rdquo; hair,
to use Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s phrase for a more obnoxious colour.&nbsp;
All were very clever, original, and utterly different to any people
or family &ldquo;E.&rdquo; had ever seen before.&nbsp; But, on the whole,
it was a happy visit to all parties.&nbsp; Charlotte says, in writing
to &ldquo;E.,&rdquo; just after her return home&mdash;&ldquo;Were I
to tell you of the impression you have made on every one here, you would
accuse me of flattery. Papa and aunt are continually adducing you as
an example for me to shape my actions and behaviour by.&nbsp; Emily
and Anne say &lsquo;they never saw any one they liked so well as you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And Tabby, whom you have absolutely fascinated, talks a great deal more
nonsense about your ladyship than I care to repeat.&nbsp; It is now
so dark that, notwithstanding the singular property of seeing in the
night-time, which the young ladies at Roe Head used to attribute to
me, I can scribble no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To a visitor at the parsonage, it was a great thing to have Tabby&rsquo;s
good word.&nbsp; She had a Yorkshire keenness of perception into character,
and it was not everybody she liked.</p>
<p>Haworth is built with an utter disregard of all sanitary conditions:
the great old churchyard lies above all the houses, and it is terrible
to think how the very water-springs of the pumps below must be poisoned.&nbsp;
But this winter of 1833-4 was particularly wet and rainy, and there
were an unusual number of deaths in the village.&nbsp; A dreary season
it was to the family in the parsonage: their usual walks obstructed
by the spongy state of the moors&mdash;the passing and funeral bells
so frequently tolling, and filling the heavy air with their mournful
sound&mdash;and, when they were still, the &ldquo;chip, chip,&rdquo;
of the mason, as he cut the grave-stones in a shed close by.&nbsp; In
many, living, as it were, in a churchyard, and with all the sights and
sounds connected with the last offices to the dead things of everyday
occurrence, the very familiarity would have bred indifference.&nbsp;
But it was otherwise with Charlotte Bront&euml;.&nbsp; One of her friends
says:&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen her turn pale and feel faint when, in
Hartshead church, some one accidentally remarked that we were walking
over graves. Charlotte was certainly afraid of death.&nbsp; Not only
of dead bodies, or dying people.&nbsp; She dreaded it as something horrible.&nbsp;
She thought we did not know how long the &lsquo;moment of dissolution&rsquo;
might really be, or how terrible.&nbsp; This was just such a terror
as only hypochondriacs can provide for themselves.&nbsp; She told me
long ago that a misfortune was often preceded by the dream frequently
repeated which she gives to &lsquo;Jane Eyre,&rsquo; of carrying a little
wailing child, and being unable to still it.&nbsp; She described herself
as having the most painful sense of pity for the little thing, lying
<i>inert</i>, as sick children do, while she walked about in some gloomy
place with it, such as the aisle of Haworth Church. The misfortunes
she mentioned were not always to herself.&nbsp; She thought such sensitiveness
to omens was like the cholera, present to susceptible people,&mdash;some
feeling more, some less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the beginning of 1834, &ldquo;E.&rdquo; went to London for
the first time.&nbsp; The idea of her friend&rsquo;s visit seems to
have stirred Charlotte strangely.&nbsp; She appears to have formed her
notions of its probable consequences from some of the papers in the
&ldquo;British Essayists,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rambler,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Mirror,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Lounger,&rdquo; which may have been among
the English classics on the parsonage bookshelves; for she evidently
imagines that an entire change of character for the worse is the usual
effect of a visit to &ldquo;the great metropolis,&rdquo; and is delighted
to find that &ldquo;E.&rdquo; is &ldquo;E.&rdquo; still.&nbsp; And,
as her faith in her friend&rsquo;s stability is restored, her own imagination
is deeply moved by the idea of what great wonders are to be seen in
that vast and famous city.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Haworth, February 20th, 1834.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter gave me real and heartfelt pleasure, mingled with
no small share of astonishment.&nbsp; Mary had previously informed me
of your departure for London, and I had not ventured to calculate on
any communication from you while surrounded by the splendours and novelties
of that great city, which has been called the mercantile metropolis
of Europe.&nbsp; Judging from human nature, I thought that a little
country girl, for the first time in a situation so well calculated to
excite curiosity, and to distract attention, would lose all remembrance,
for a time at least, of distant and familiar objects, and give herself
up entirely to the fascination of those scenes which were then presented
to her view.&nbsp; Your kind, interesting, and most welcome epistle
showed me, however, that I had been both mistaken and uncharitable in
these suppositions.&nbsp; I was greatly amused at the tone of nonchalance
which you assumed, while treating of London and its wonders.&nbsp; Did
you not feel awed while gazing at St. Paul&rsquo;s and Westminster Abbey?&nbsp;
Had you no feeling of intense and ardent interest, when in St. James&rsquo;s
you saw the palace where so many of England&rsquo;s kings have held
their courts, and beheld the representations of their persons on the
walls?&nbsp; You should not be too much afraid of appearing <i>country-bred</i>;
the magnificence of London has drawn exclamations of astonishment from
travelled men, experienced in the world, its wonders and beauties.&nbsp;
Have you yet seen anything of the great personages whom the sitting
of Parliament now detains in London&mdash;the Duke of Wellington, Sir
Robert Peel, Earl Grey, Mr. Stanley, Mr. O&rsquo;Connell?&nbsp; If I
were you, I would not be too anxious to spend my time in reading whilst
in town.&nbsp; Make use of your own eyes for the purposes of observation
now, and, for a time at least, lay aside the spectacles with which authors
would furnish us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a postscript she adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Will you be kind enough to inform me of the number
of performers in the King&rsquo;s military band?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in something of the same strain she writes on</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 19th.<br />
&ldquo;My own Dear E.,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may rightfully and truly call you so now.&nbsp; You <i>have</i>
returned or <i>are</i> returning from London&mdash;from the great city
which is to me as apocryphal as Babylon, or Nineveh, or ancient Rome.&nbsp;
You are withdrawing from the world (as it is called), and bringing with
you&mdash;if your letters enable me to form a correct judgment&mdash;a
heart as unsophisticated, as natural, as true, as that you carried there.&nbsp;
I am slow, <i>very</i> slow, to believe the protestations of another;
I know my own sentiments, I can read my own mind, but the minds of the
rest of man and woman kind are to me sealed volumes, hieroglyphical
scrolls, which I cannot easily either unseal or decipher.&nbsp; Yet
time, careful study, long acquaintance, overcome most difficulties;
and, in your case, I think they have succeeded well in bringing to light
and construing that hidden language, whose turnings, windings, inconsistencies,
and obscurities, so frequently baffle the researches of the honest observer
of human nature . . . I am truly grateful for your mindfulness of so
obscure a person as myself, and I hope the pleasure is not altogether
selfish; I trust it is partly derived from the consciousness that my
friend&rsquo;s character is of a higher, a more steadfast order than
I was once perfectly aware of.&nbsp; Few girls would have done as you
have done&mdash;would have beheld the glare, and glitter, and dazzling
display of London with dispositions so unchanged, heart so uncontaminated.&nbsp;
I see no affectation in your letters, no trifling, no frivolous contempt
of plain, and weak admiration of showy persons and things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these days of cheap railway trips, we may smile at the idea of
a short visit to London having any great effect upon the character,
whatever it may have upon the intellect.&nbsp; But her London&mdash;her
great apocryphal city&mdash;was the &ldquo;town&rdquo; of a century
before, to which giddy daughters dragged unwilling papas, or went with
injudicious friends, to the detriment of all their better qualities,
and sometimes to the ruin of their fortunes; it was the Vanity Fair
of the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; to her.</p>
<p>But see the just and admirable sense with which she can treat a subject
of which she is able to overlook all the bearings.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Haworth, July 4th, 1834.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your last, you request me to tell you of your faults.&nbsp;
Now, really, how can you be so foolish!&nbsp; I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> tell
you of your faults, because I don&rsquo;t know them.&nbsp; What a creature
would that be, who, after receiving an affectionate and kind letter
from a beloved friend, should sit down and write a catalogue of defects
by way of answer!&nbsp; Imagine me doing so, and then consider what
epithets you would bestow on me.&nbsp; Conceited, dogmatical, hypocritical,
little humbug, I should think, would be the mildest. Why, child!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve neither time nor inclination to reflect on your <i>faults</i>
when you are so far from me, and when, besides, kind letters and presents,
and so forth, are continually bringing forth your goodness in the most
prominent light.&nbsp; Then, too, there are judicious relations always
round you, who can much better discharge that unpleasant office.&nbsp;
I have no doubt their advice is completely at your service; why then
should I intrude mine?&nbsp; If you will not hear them, it will be vain
though one should rise from the dead to instruct you.&nbsp; Let us have
no more nonsense, if you love me.&nbsp; Mr. --- is going to be married,
is he?&nbsp; Well, his wife elect appeared to me to be a clever and
amiable lady, as far as I could judge from the little I saw of her,
and from your account. Now to that flattering sentence must I tack on
a list of her faults?&nbsp; You say it is in contemplation for you to
leave ---.&nbsp; I am sorry for it.&nbsp; --- is a pleasant spot, one
of the old family halls of England, surrounded by lawn and woodland,
speaking of past times, and suggesting (to me at least) happy feelings.&nbsp;
M. thought you grown less, did she?&nbsp; I am not grown a bit, but
as short and dumpy as ever.&nbsp; You ask me to recommend you some books
for your perusal. I will do so in as few words as I can.&nbsp; If you
like poetry, let it be first-rate; Milton, Shakspeare, Thomson, Goldsmith,
Pope (if you will, though I don&rsquo;t admire him), Scott, Byron, Campbell,
Wordsworth, and Southey.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t be startled at the names
of Shakspeare and Byron.&nbsp; Both these were great men, and their
works are like themselves.&nbsp; You will know how to choose the good,
and to avoid the evil; the finest passages are always the purest, the
bad are invariably revolting; you will never wish to read them over
twice.&nbsp; Omit the comedies of Shakspeare, and the Don Juan, perhaps
the Cain, of Byron, though the latter is a magnificent poem, and read
the rest fearlessly; that must indeed be a depraved mind which can gather
evil from Henry VIII., from Richard III., from Macbeth, and Hamlet,
and Julius C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s sweet, wild, romantic poetry
can do you no harm.&nbsp; Nor can Wordsworth&rsquo;s, nor Campbell&rsquo;s,
nor Southey&rsquo;s&mdash;the greatest part at least of his; some is
certainly objectionable.&nbsp; For history, read Hume, Rollin, and the
Universal History, if you can; I never did.&nbsp; For fiction, read
Scott alone; all novels after his are worthless.&nbsp; For biography,
read Johnson&rsquo;s Lives of the Poets, Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson,
Southey&rsquo;s Life of Nelson, Lockhart&rsquo;s Life of Burns, Moore&rsquo;s
Life of Sheridan, Moore&rsquo;s Life of Byron, Wolfe&rsquo;s Remains.&nbsp;
For natural history, read Bewick and Audubon, and Goldsmith and White&rsquo;s
history of Selborne.&nbsp; For divinity, your brother will advise you
there.&nbsp; I can only say, adhere to standard authors, and avoid novelty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this list, we see that she must have had a good range of books
from which to choose her own reading.&nbsp; It is evident, that the
womanly consciences of these two correspondents were anxiously alive
to many questions discussed among the stricter religionists. The morality
of Shakspeare needed the confirmation of Charlotte&rsquo;s opinion to
the sensitive &ldquo;E.;&rdquo; and a little later, she inquired whether
dancing was objectionable, when indulged in for an hour or two in parties
of boys and girls.&nbsp; Charlotte replies, &ldquo;I should hesitate
to express a difference of opinion from Mr. ---, or from your excellent
sister, but really the matter seems to me to stand thus.&nbsp; It is
allowed on all hands, that the sin of dancing consists not in the mere
action of &lsquo;shaking the shanks&rsquo; (as the Scotch say), but
in the consequences that usually attend it; namely, frivolity and waste
of time; when it is used only, as in the case you state, for the exercise
and amusement of an hour among young people (who surely may without
any breach of God&rsquo;s commandments be allowed a little light-heartedness),
these consequences cannot follow.&nbsp; Ergo (according to my manner
of arguing), the amusement is at such times perfectly innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the distance between Haworth and B--- was but seventeen
miles, it was difficult to go straight from the one to the other without
hiring a gig or vehicle of some kind for the journey. Hence a visit
from Charlotte required a good deal of pre-arrangement.&nbsp; <i>The</i>
Haworth gig was not always to be had; and Mr. Bront&euml; was often
unwilling to fall into any arrangement for meeting at Bradford or other
places, which would occasion trouble to others.&nbsp; The whole family
had an ample share of that sensitive pride which led them to dread incurring
obligations, and to fear &ldquo;outstaying their welcome&rdquo; when
on any visit.&nbsp; I am not sure whether Mr. Bront&euml; did not consider
distrust of others as a part of that knowledge of human nature on which
he piqued himself.&nbsp; His precepts to this effect, combined with
Charlotte&rsquo;s lack of hope, made her always fearful of loving too
much; of wearying the objects of her affection; and thus she was often
trying to restrain her warm feelings, and was ever chary of that presence
so invariably welcome to her true friends.&nbsp; According to this mode
of acting, when she was invited for a month, she stayed but a fortnight
amidst &ldquo;E.&rsquo;s&rdquo; family, to whom every visit only endeared
her the more, and by whom she was received with that kind of quiet gladness
with which they would have greeted a sister.</p>
<p>She still kept up her childish interest in politics.&nbsp; In March,
1835, she writes: &ldquo;What do you think of the course politics are
taking?&nbsp; I make this enquiry, because I now think you take a wholesome
interest in the matter; formerly you did not care greatly about it.&nbsp;
B., you see, is triumphant.&nbsp; Wretch!&nbsp; I am a hearty hater,
and if there is any one I thoroughly abhor, it is that man.&nbsp; But
the Opposition is divided, Red-hots, and Luke-warms; and the Duke (par
excellence <i>the</i> Duke) and Sir Robert Peel show no signs of insecurity,
though they have been twice beat; so &lsquo;Courage, mon amie,&rsquo;
as the old chevaliers used to say, before they joined battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of the summer of 1835, a great family plan was mooted
at the parsonage.&nbsp; The question was, to what trade or profession
should Branwell be brought up?&nbsp; He was now nearly eighteen; it
was time to decide.&nbsp; He was very clever, no doubt; perhaps to begin
with, the greatest genius in this rare family. The sisters hardly recognised
their own, or each others&rsquo; powers, but they knew <i>his</i>.&nbsp;
The father, ignorant of many failings in moral conduct, did proud homage
to the great gifts of his son; for Branwell&rsquo;s talents were readily
and willingly brought out for the entertainment of others.&nbsp; Popular
admiration was sweet to him. And this led to his presence being sought
at &ldquo;arvills&rdquo; and all the great village gatherings, for the
Yorkshiremen have a keen relish for intellect; and it likewise procured
him the undesirable distinction of having his company recommended by
the landlord of the Black Bull to any chance traveller who might happen
to feel solitary or dull over his liquor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want some
one to help you with your bottle, sir?&nbsp; If you do, I&rsquo;ll send
up for Patrick&rdquo; (so the villagers called him till the day of his
death, though in his own family he was always &ldquo;Branwell&rdquo;).&nbsp;
And while the messenger went, the landlord entertained his guest with
accounts of the wonderful talents of the boy, whose precocious cleverness,
and great conversational powers, were the pride of the village.&nbsp;
The attacks of ill health to which Mr. Bront&euml; had been subject
of late years, rendered it not only necessary that he should take his
dinner alone (for the sake of avoiding temptations to unwholesome diet),
but made it also desirable that he should pass the time directly succeeding
his meals in perfect quiet.&nbsp; And this necessity, combined with
due attention to his parochial duties, made him partially ignorant how
his son employed himself out of lesson-time.&nbsp; His own youth had
been spent among people of the same conventional rank as those into
whose companionship Branwell was now thrown; but he had had a strong
will, and an earnest and persevering ambition, and a resoluteness of
purpose which his weaker son wanted.</p>
<p>It is singular how strong a yearning the whole family had towards
the art of drawing.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; had been very solicitous to
get them good instruction; the girls themselves loved everything connected
with it&mdash;all descriptions or engravings of great pictures; and,
in default of good ones, they would take and analyse any print or drawing
which came in their way, and find out how much thought had gone to its
composition, what ideas it was intended to suggest, and what it <i>did</i>
suggest.&nbsp; In the same spirit, they laboured to design imaginations
of their own; they lacked the power of execution, not of conception.&nbsp;
At one time, Charlotte had the notion of making her living as an artist,
and wearied her eyes in drawing with pre-Raphaelite minuteness, but
not with pre-Raphaelite accuracy, for she drew from fancy rather than
from nature.</p>
<p>But they all thought there could be no doubt about Branwell&rsquo;s
talent for drawing.&nbsp; I have seen an oil painting of his, done I
know not when, but probably about this time.&nbsp; It was a group of
his sisters, life-size, three-quarters&rsquo; length; not much better
than sign-painting, as to manipulation; but the likenesses were, I should
think, admirable.&nbsp; I could only judge of the fidelity with which
the other two were depicted, from the striking resemblance which Charlotte,
upholding the great frame of canvas, and consequently standing right
behind it, bore to her own representation, though it must have been
ten years and more since the portraits were taken.&nbsp; The picture
was divided, almost in the middle, by a great pillar.&nbsp; On the side
of the column which was lighted by the sun, stood Charlotte, in the
womanly dress of that day of gigot sleeves and large collars.&nbsp;
On the deeply shadowed side, was Emily, with Anne&rsquo;s gentle face
resting on her shoulder. Emily&rsquo;s countenance struck me as full
of power; Charlotte&rsquo;s of solicitude; Anne&rsquo;s of tenderness.&nbsp;
The two younger seemed hardly to have attained their full growth, though
Emily was taller than Charlotte; they had cropped hair, and a more girlish
dress.&nbsp; I remember looking on those two sad, earnest, shadowed
faces, and wondering whether I could trace the mysterious expression
which is said to foretell an early death.&nbsp; I had some fond superstitious
hope that the column divided their fates from hers, who stood apart
in the canvas, as in life she survived.&nbsp; I liked to see that the
bright side of the pillar was towards <i>her</i>&mdash;that the light
in the picture fell on <i>her</i>: I might more truly have sought in
her presentment&mdash;nay, in her living face&mdash;for the sign of
death&mdash;in her prime.&nbsp; They were good likenesses, however badly
executed. From thence I should guess his family augured truly that,
if Branwell had but the opportunity, and, alas! had but the moral qualities,
he might turn out a great painter.</p>
<p>The best way of preparing him to become so appeared to be to send
him as a pupil to the Royal Academy.&nbsp; I dare say he longed and
yearned to follow this path, principally because it would lead him to
that mysterious London&mdash;that Babylon the great&mdash;which seems
to have filled the imaginations and haunted the minds of all the younger
members of this recluse family.&nbsp; To Branwell it was more than a
vivid imagination, it was an impressed reality.&nbsp; By dint of studying
maps, he was as well acquainted with it, even down to its by-ways, as
if he had lived there.&nbsp; Poor misguided fellow! this craving to
see and know London, and that stronger craving after fame, were never
to be satisfied.&nbsp; He was to die at the end of a short and blighted
life.&nbsp; But in this year of 1835, all his home kindred were thinking
how they could best forward his views, and how help him up to the pinnacle
where he desired to be.&nbsp; What their plans were, let Charlotte explain.&nbsp;
These are not the first sisters who have laid their lives as a sacrifice
before their brother&rsquo;s idolized wish.&nbsp; Would to God they
might be the last who met with such a miserable return!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Haworth, July 6th, 1835.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped to have had the extreme pleasure of seeing you
at Haworth this summer, but human affairs are mutable, and human resolutions
must bend to the course of events.&nbsp; We are all about to divide,
break up, separate.&nbsp; Emily is going to school, Branwell is going
to London, and I am going to be a governess.&nbsp; This last determination
I formed myself, knowing that I should have to take the step sometime,
&lsquo;and better sune as syne,&rsquo; to use the Scotch proverb; and
knowing well that papa would have enough to do with his limited income,
should Branwell be placed at the Royal Academy, and Emily at Roe Head.&nbsp;
Where am I going to reside? you will ask.&nbsp; Within four miles of
you, at a place neither of us is unacquainted with, being no other than
the identical Roe Head mentioned above.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I am going
to teach in the very school where I was myself taught.&nbsp; Miss W---
made me the offer, and I preferred it to one or two proposals of private
governess-ship, which I had before received.&nbsp; I am sad&mdash;very
sad&mdash;at the thoughts of leaving home; but duty&mdash;necessity&mdash;these
are stern mistresses, who will not be disobeyed.&nbsp; Did I not once
say you ought to be thankful for your independence?&nbsp; I felt what
I said at the time, and I repeat it now with double earnestness; if
anything would cheer me, it is the idea of being so near you.&nbsp;
Surely, you and Polly will come and see me; it would be wrong in me
to doubt it; you were never unkind yet.&nbsp; Emily and I leave home
on the 27th of this month; the idea of being together consoles us both
somewhat, and, truth, since I must enter a situation, &lsquo;My lines
have fallen in pleasant places.&rsquo;&nbsp; I both love and respect
Miss W-.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>On the 29th of July, 1835, Charlotte, now a little more than nineteen
years old, went as teacher to Miss W---&rsquo;s. Emily accompanied her
as a pupil; but she became literally ill from home-sickness, and could
not settle to anything, and after passing only three months at Roe Head,
returned to the parsonage and the beloved moors.</p>
<p>Miss Bront&euml; gives the following reasons as those which prevented
Emily&rsquo;s remaining at school, and caused the substitution of her
younger sister in her place at Miss W---&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister Emily loved the moors.&nbsp; Flowers brighter than
the rose bloomed in the blackest of the heath for her;&mdash;out of
a sullen hollow in a livid hill-side, her mind could make an Eden.&nbsp;
She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights; and not the
least and best-loved was&mdash;liberty.&nbsp; Liberty was the breath
of Emily&rsquo;s nostrils; without it she perished.&nbsp; The change
from her own home to a school, and from her own very noiseless, very
secluded, but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of
disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she
failed in enduring.&nbsp; Her nature proved here too strong for her
fortitude.&nbsp; Every morning, when she woke, the vision of home and
the moors rushed on her, and darkened and saddened the day that lay
before her.&nbsp; Nobody knew what ailed her but me.&nbsp; I knew only
too well.&nbsp; In this struggle her health was quickly broken: her
white face, attenuated form, and failing strength, threatened rapid
decline.&nbsp; I felt in my heart she would die, if she did not go home,
and with this conviction obtained her recall.&nbsp; She had only been
three months at school; and it was some years before the experiment
of sending her from home was again ventured on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This physical suffering on Emily&rsquo;s part when absent from Haworth,
after recurring several times under similar circumstances, became at
length so much an acknowledged fact, that whichever was obliged to leave
home, the sisters decided that Emily must remain there, where alone
she could enjoy anything like good health.&nbsp; She left it twice again
in her life; once going as teacher to a school in Halifax for six months,
and afterwards accompanying Charlotte to Brussels for ten.&nbsp; When
at home, she took the principal part of the cooking upon herself, and
did all the household ironing; and after Tabby grew old and infirm,
it was Emily who made all the bread for the family; and any one passing
by the kitchen-door, might have seen her studying German out of an open
book, propped up before her, as she kneaded the dough; but no study,
however interesting, interfered with the goodness of the bread, which
was always light and excellent.&nbsp; Books were, indeed, a very common
sight in that kitchen; the girls were taught by their father theoretically,
and by their aunt, practically, that to take an active part in all household
work was, in their position, woman&rsquo;s simple duty; but in their
careful employment of time, they found many an odd five minutes for
reading while watching the cakes, and managed the union of two kinds
of employment better than King Alfred.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s life at Miss W---&rsquo;s was a very happy one,
until her health failed.&nbsp; She sincerely loved and respected the
former schoolmistress, to whom she was now become both companion and
friend.&nbsp; The girls were hardly strangers to her, some of them being
younger sisters of those who had been her own playmates.&nbsp; Though
the duties of the day might be tedious and monotonous, there were always
two or three happy hours to look forward to in the evening, when she
and Miss W--- sat together&mdash;sometimes late into the night&mdash;and
had quiet pleasant conversations, or pauses of silence as agreeable,
because each felt that as soon as a thought or remark occurred which
they wished to express, there was an intelligent companion ready to
sympathise, and yet they were not compelled to &ldquo;make talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss W--- was always anxious to afford Miss Bront&euml; every opportunity
of recreation in her power; but the difficulty often was to persuade
her to avail herself of the invitations which came, urging her to spend
Saturday and Sunday with &ldquo;E.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; in
their respective homes, that lay within the distance of a walk.&nbsp;
She was too apt to consider, that allowing herself a holiday was a dereliction
of duty, and to refuse herself the necessary change, from something
of an over-ascetic spirit, betokening a loss of healthy balance in either
body or mind.&nbsp; Indeed, it is clear that such was the case, from
a passage, referring to this time, in the letter of &ldquo;Mary&rdquo;
from which I have before given extracts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years after&mdash;&rdquo; (the period when they were
at school together)&mdash;&ldquo;I heard that she had gone as teacher
to Miss W---&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I went to see her, and asked how she could
give so much for so little money, when she could live without it.&nbsp;
She owned that, after clothing herself and Anne, there was nothing left,
though she had hoped to be able to save something.&nbsp; She confessed
it was not brilliant, but what could she do?&nbsp; I had nothing to
answer.&nbsp; She seemed to have no interest or pleasure beyond the
feeling of duty, and, when she could get, used to sit alone, and &lsquo;make
out.&rsquo;&nbsp; She told me afterwards, that one evening she had sat
in the dressing-room until it was quite dark, and then observing it
all at once, had taken sudden fright.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt she remembered
this well when she described a similar terror getting hold upon Jane
Eyre.&nbsp; She says in the story, &ldquo;I sat looking at the white
bed and overshadowed walls&mdash;occasionally turning a fascinated eye
towards the gleaming mirror&mdash;I began to recall what I had heard
of dead men troubled in their graves . . . I endeavoured to be firm;
shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly
through the dark room; at this moment, a ray from the moon penetrated
some aperture in the blind.&nbsp; No! moon light was still, and this
stirred . . . prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves
were by agitation, I thought the swift-darting beam was a herald of
some coming vision from another world.&nbsp; My heart beat thick, my
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears which I deemed the rustling of
wings; something seemed near me.&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;From that time,&rdquo; Mary adds, &ldquo;her imaginations
became gloomy or frightful; she could not help it, nor help thinking.&nbsp;
She could not forget the gloom, could not sleep at night, nor attend
in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me that one night, sitting alone, about this time,
she heard a voice repeat these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come thou high and holy feeling,<br />
Shine o&rsquo;er mountain, flit o&rsquo;er wave,<br />
Gleam like light o&rsquo;er dome and shielding.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There were eight or ten more lines which I forget.&nbsp; She
insisted that she had not made them, that she had heard a voice repeat
them.&nbsp; It is possible that she had read them, and unconsciously
recalled them.&nbsp; They are not in the volume of poems which the sisters
published.&nbsp; She repeated a verse of Isaiah, which she said had
inspired them, and which I have forgotten.&nbsp; Whether the lines were
recollected or invented, the tale proves such habits of sedentary, monotonous
solitude of thought as would have shaken a feebler mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the state of health thus described came on gradually,
and is not to be taken as a picture of her condition in 1836.&nbsp;
Yet even then there is a despondency in some of her expressions, that
too sadly reminds one of some of Cowper&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; And it
is remarkable how deeply his poems impressed her.&nbsp; His words, his
verses, came more frequently to her memory, I imagine, than those of
any other poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Cowper&rsquo;s poem, &lsquo;The Castaway,&rsquo;
was known to them all, and they all at times appreciated, or almost
appropriated it.&nbsp; Charlotte told me once that Branwell had done
so; and though his depression was the result of his faults, it was in
no other respect different from hers.&nbsp; Both were not mental but
physical illnesses.&nbsp; She was well aware of this, and would ask
how that mended matters, as the feeling was there all the same, and
was not removed by knowing the cause.&nbsp; She had a larger religious
toleration than a person would have who had never questioned, and the
manner of recommending religion was always that of offering comfort,
not fiercely enforcing a duty.&nbsp; One time I mentioned that some
one had asked me what religion I was of (with the view of getting me
for a partizan), and that I had said that that was between God and me;&mdash;Emily
(who was lying on the hearth-rug) exclaimed, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This was all I ever heard Emily say on religious subjects.&nbsp; Charlotte
was free from religious depression when in tolerable health; when that
failed, her depression returned.&nbsp; You have probably seen such instances.&nbsp;
They don&rsquo;t get over their difficulties; they forget them, when
their stomach (or whatever organ it is that inflicts such misery on
sedentary people) will let them.&nbsp; I have heard her condemn Socinianism,
Calvinism, and many other &lsquo;isms&rsquo; inconsistent with Church
of Englandism.&nbsp; I used to wonder at her acquaintance with such
subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May 10th, 1836.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was struck with the note you sent me with the umbrella;
it showed a degree of interest in my concerns which I have no right
to expect from any earthly creature.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t play the hypocrite;
I won&rsquo;t answer your kind, gentle, friendly questions in the way
you wish me to.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t deceive yourself by imagining I have
a bit of real goodness about me.&nbsp; My darling, if I were like you,
I should have my face Zion-ward, though prejudice and error might occasionally
fling a mist over the glorious vision before me&mdash;but I <i>am not
like you</i>.&nbsp; If you knew my thoughts, the dreams that absorb
me, and the fiery imagination that at times eats me up, and makes me
feel society, as it is, wretchedly insipid, you would pity and I dare
say despise me.&nbsp; But I know the treasures of the <i>Bible</i>;
I love and adore them.&nbsp; I can <i>see</i> the Well of Life in all
its clearness and brightness; but when I stoop down to drink of the
pure waters they fly from my lips as if I were Tantalus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are far too kind and frequent in your invitations.&nbsp;
You puzzle me.&nbsp; I hardly know how to refuse, and it is still more
embarrassing to accept.&nbsp; At any rate, I cannot come this week,
for we are in the very thickest mel&eacute;e of the Repetitions.&nbsp;
I was hearing the terrible fifth section when your note arrived.&nbsp;
But Miss Wooler says I must go to Mary next Friday, as she promised
for me on Whit-Sunday; and on Sunday morning I will join you at church,
if it be convenient, and stay till Monday.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a free
and easy proposal!&nbsp; Miss W--- has driven me to it.&nbsp; She says
her character is implicated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good, kind Miss W---! however monotonous and trying were the duties
Charlotte had to perform under her roof, there was always a genial and
thoughtful friend watching over her, and urging her to partake of any
little piece of innocent recreation that might come in her way.&nbsp;
And in those Midsummer holidays of 1836, her friend E. came to stay
with her at Haworth, so there was one happy time secured.</p>
<p>Here follows a series of letters, not dated, but belonging to the
latter portion of this year; and again we think of the gentle and melancholy
Cowper.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear dear E.,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at this moment trembling all over with excitement, after
reading your note; it is what I never received before&mdash;it is the
unrestrained pouring out of a warm, gentle, generous heart . . . I thank
you with energy for this kindness.&nbsp; I will no longer shrink from
answering your questions.&nbsp; I <i>do</i> wish to be better than I
am.&nbsp; I pray fervently sometimes to be made so.&nbsp; I have stings
of conscience, visitings of remorse, glimpses of holy, of inexpressible
things, which formerly I used to be a stranger to; it may all die away,
and I may be in utter midnight, but I implore a merciful Redeemer, that,
if this be the dawn of the gospel, it may still brighten to perfect
day.&nbsp; Do not mistake me&mdash;do not think I am good; I only wish
to be so.&nbsp; I only hate my former flippancy and forwardness.&nbsp;
Oh! I am no better than ever I was.&nbsp; I am in that state of horrid,
gloomy uncertainty that, at this moment, I would submit to be old, grey-haired,
to have passed all my youthful days of enjoyment, and to be settling
on the verge of the grave, if I could only thereby ensure the prospect
of reconciliation to God, and redemption through his Son&rsquo;s merits.&nbsp;
I never was exactly careless of these matters, but I have always taken
a clouded and repulsive view of them; and now, if possible, the clouds
are gathering darker, and a more oppressive despondency weighs on my
spirits.&nbsp; You have cheered me, my darling; for one moment, for
an atom of time, I thought I might call you my own sister in the spirit;
but the excitement is past, and I am now as wretched and hopeless as
ever.&nbsp; This very night I will pray as you wish me.&nbsp; May the
Almighty hear me compassionately! and I humbly hope he will, for you
will strengthen my polluted petitions with your own pure requests.&nbsp;
All is bustle and confusion round me, the ladies pressing with their
sums and their lessons . . . If you love me, <i>do, do, do</i> come
on Friday: I shall watch and wait for you, and if you disappoint me
I shall weep.&nbsp; I wish you could know the thrill of delight which
I experienced, when, as I stood at the dining-room window, I saw ---,
as he whirled past, toss your little packet over the wall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huddersfield market-day was still the great period for events at
Roe Head.&nbsp; Then girls, running round the corner of the house and
peeping between tree-stems, and up a shadowy lane, could catch a glimpse
of a father or brother driving to market in his gig; might, perhaps,
exchange a wave of the hand; or see, as Charlotte Bront&euml; did from
the window, a white packet tossed over the avail by come swift strong
motion of an arm, the rest of the traveller&rsquo;s body unseen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weary with a day&rsquo;s hard work . . . I am sitting down
to write a few lines to my dear E.&nbsp; Excuse me if I say nothing
but nonsense, for my mind is exhausted and dispirited.&nbsp; It is a
stormy evening, and the wind is uttering a continual moaning sound,
that makes me feel very melancholy.&nbsp; At such times&mdash;in such
moods as these&mdash;it is my nature to seek repose in some calm tranquil
idea, and I have now summoned up your image to give me rest.&nbsp; There
you sit, upright and still in your black dress, and white scarf, and
pale marble-like face&mdash;just like reality.&nbsp; I wish you would
speak to me.&nbsp; If we should be separated&mdash;if it should be our
lot to live at a great distance, and never to see each other again&mdash;in
old age, how I should conjure up the memory of my youthful days, and
what a melancholy pleasure I should feel in dwelling on the recollection
of my early friend! . . . I have some qualities that make me very miserable,
some feelings that you can have no participation in&mdash;that few,
very few, people in the world can at all understand.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
pride myself on these peculiarities.&nbsp; I strive to conceal and suppress
them as much as I can; but they burst out sometimes, and then those
who see the explosion despise me, and I hate myself for days afterwards
. . . I have just received your epistle and what accompanied it.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t tell what should induce you and your sisters to waste
your kindness on such a one as me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m obliged to them,
and I hope you&rsquo;ll tell them so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m obliged to you
also, more for your note than for your present.&nbsp; The first gave
me pleasure, the last something like pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The nervous disturbance, which is stated to have troubled her while
she was at Miss W---&rsquo;s, seems to have begun to distress her about
this time; at least, she herself speaks of her irritable condition,
which was certainly only a temporary ailment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been very kind to me of late, and have spared me
all those little sallies of ridicule, which, owing to my miserable and
wretched touchiness of character, used formerly to make me wince, as
if I had been touched with a hot iron; things that nobody else cares
for, enter into my mind and rankle there like venom.&nbsp; I know these
feelings are absurd, and therefore I try to hide them, but they only
sting the deeper for concealment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compare this state of mind with the gentle resignation with which
she had submitted to be put aside as useless, or told of her ugliness
by her school-fellows, only three years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life since I saw you has passed as monotonously and unbroken
as ever; nothing but teach, teach, teach, from morning till night.&nbsp;
The greatest variety I ever have is afforded by a letter from you, or
by meeting with a pleasant new book.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Life of Oberlin,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Leigh Richmond&rsquo;s Domestic Portraiture,&rsquo; are the
last of this description.&nbsp; The latter work strongly attracted and
strangely fascinated my attention.&nbsp; Beg, borrow, or steal it without
delay; and read the &lsquo;Memoir of Wilberforce,&rsquo;&mdash;that
short record of a brief uneventful life; I shall never forget it; it
is beautiful, not on account of the language in which it is written,
not on account of the incidents it details, but because of the simple
narrative it gives of a young talented sincere Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>About this time Miss W--- removed her school from the fine, open,
breezy situation of Roe Head, to Dewsbury Moor, only two or three miles
distant.&nbsp; Her new residence was on a lower site, and the air was
less exhilarating to one bred in the wild hill-village of Haworth.&nbsp;
Emily had gone as teacher to a school at Halifax, where there were nearly
forty pupils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had one letter from her since her departure,&rdquo;
writes Charlotte, on October 2nd, 1836: &ldquo;it gives an appalling
account of her duties; hard labour from six in the morning to eleven
at night, with only one half-hour of exercise between.&nbsp; This is
slavery.&nbsp; I fear she can never stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>When the sisters met at home in the Christmas holidays, they talked
over their lives, and the prospect which they afforded of employment
and remuneration.&nbsp; They felt that it was a duty to relieve their
father of the burden of their support, if not entirely, or that of all
three, at least that of one or two; and, naturally, the lot devolved
upon the elder ones to find some occupation which would enable them
to do this.&nbsp; They knew that they were never likely to inherit much
money.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; had but a small stipend, and was both charitable
and liberal.&nbsp; Their aunt had an annuity of 50<i>l</i>., but it
reverted to others at her death, and her nieces had no right, and were
the last persons in the world to reckon upon her savings.&nbsp; What
could they do?&nbsp; Charlotte and Emily were trying teaching, and,
as it seemed, without much success.&nbsp; The former, it is true, had
the happiness of having a friend for her employer, and of being surrounded
by those who knew her and loved her; but her salary was too small for
her to save out of it; and her education did not entitle her to a larger.&nbsp;
The sedentary and monotonous nature of the life, too, was preying upon
her health and spirits, although, with necessity &ldquo;as her mistress,&rdquo;
she might hardly like to acknowledge this even to herself.&nbsp; But
Emily&mdash;that free, wild, untameable spirit, never happy nor well
but on the sweeping moors that gathered round her home&mdash;that hater
of strangers, doomed to live amongst them, and not merely to live but
to slave in their service&mdash;what Charlotte could have borne patiently
for herself, she could not bear for her sister.&nbsp; And yet what to
do?&nbsp; She had once hoped that she herself might become an artist,
and so earn her livelihood; but her eyes had failed her in the minute
and useless labour which she had imposed upon herself with a view to
this end.</p>
<p>It was the household custom among these girls to sew till nine o&rsquo;clock
at night.&nbsp; At that hour, Miss Branwell generally went to bed, and
her nieces&rsquo; duties for the day were accounted done.&nbsp; They
put away their work, and began to pace the room backwards and forwards,
up and down,&mdash;as often with the candles extinguished, for economy&rsquo;s
sake, as not,&mdash;their figures glancing into the fire-light, and
out into the shadow, perpetually.&nbsp; At this time, they talked over
past cares and troubles; they planned for the future, and consulted
each other as to their plans.&nbsp; In after years this was the time
for discussing together the plots of their novels.&nbsp; And again,
still later, this was the time for the last surviving sister to walk
alone, from old accustomed habit, round and round the desolate room,
thinking sadly upon the &ldquo;days that were no more.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But this Christmas of 1836 was not without its hopes and daring aspirations.&nbsp;
They had tried their hands at story-writing, in their miniature magazine,
long ago; they all of them &ldquo;made out&rdquo; perpetually.&nbsp;
They had likewise attempted to write poetry; and had a modest confidence
that they had achieved a tolerable success.&nbsp; But they knew that
they might deceive themselves, and that sisters&rsquo; judgments of
each other&rsquo;s productions were likely to be too partial to be depended
upon.&nbsp; So Charlotte, as the eldest, resolved to write to Southey.&nbsp;
I believe (from an expression in a letter to be noticed hereafter),
that she also consulted Coleridge; but I have not met with any part
of that correspondence.</p>
<p>On December 29th, her letter to Southey was despatched; and from
an excitement not unnatural in a girl who has worked herself up to the
pitch of writing to a Poet Laureate and asking his opinion of her poems,
she used some high-flown expressions which, probably, gave him the idea
that she was a romantic young lady, unacquainted with the realities
of life.</p>
<p>This, most likely, was the first of those adventurous letters that
passed through the little post-office of Haworth.&nbsp; Morning after
morning of the holidays slipped away, and there was no answer; the sisters
had to leave home, and Emily to return to her distasteful duties, without
knowing even whether Charlotte&rsquo;s letter had ever reached its destination.</p>
<p>Not dispirited, however, by the delay, Branwell determined to try
a similar venture, and addressed the following letter to Wordsworth.&nbsp;
It was given by the poet to Mr. Quillinan in 1850, after the name of
Bront&euml; had become known and famous.&nbsp; I have no means of ascertaining
what answer was returned by Mr. Wordsworth; but that he considered the
letter remarkable may, I think, be inferred both from its preservation,
and its recurrence to his memory when the real name of Currer Bell was
made known to the public.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Haworth, near Bradford,<br />
&ldquo;Yorkshire, January 19, 1837.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I most earnestly entreat you to read and pass your
judgment upon what I have sent you, because from the day of my birth
to this the nineteenth year of my life, I have lived among secluded
hills, where I could neither know what I was, or what I could do.&nbsp;
I read for the same reason that I ate or drank; because it was a real
craving of nature.&nbsp; I wrote on the same principle as I spoke&mdash;out
of the impulse and feelings of the mind; nor could I help it, for what
came, came out, and there was the end of it.&nbsp; For as to self-conceit,
that could not receive food from flattery, since to this hour, not half
a dozen people in the world know that I have ever penned a line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a change has taken place now, sir: and I am arrived at
an age wherein I must do something for myself: the powers I possess
must be exercised to a definite end, and as I don&rsquo;t know them
myself I must ask of others what they are worth.&nbsp; Yet there is
not one here to tell me; and still, if they are worthless, time will
henceforth be too precious to be wasted on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do pardon me, sir, that I have ventured to come before one
whose works I have most loved in our literature, and who most has been
with me a divinity of the mind, laying before him one of my writings,
and asking of him a judgment of its contents.&nbsp; I must come before
some one from whose sentence there is no appeal; and such a one is he
who has developed the theory of poetry as well as its practice, and
both in such a way as to claim a place in the memory of a thousand years
to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aim, sir, is to push out into the open world, and for this
I trust not poetry alone&mdash;that might launch the vessel, but could
not bear her on; sensible and scientific prose, bold and vigorous efforts
in my walk in life, would give a farther title to the notice of the
world; and then again poetry ought to brighten and crown that name with
glory; but nothing of all this can be ever begun without means, and
as I don&rsquo;t possess these, I must in every shape strive to gain
them.&nbsp; Surely, in this day, when there is not a <i>writing</i>
poet worth a sixpence, the field must be open, if a better man can step
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I send you is the Prefatory Scene of a much longer subject,
in which I have striven to develop strong passions and weak principles
struggling with a high imagination and acute feelings, till, as youth
hardens towards age, evil deeds and short enjoyments end in mental misery
and bodily ruin.&nbsp; Now, to send you the whole of this would be a
mock upon your patience; what you see, does not even pretend to be more
than the description of an imaginative child.&nbsp; But read it, sir;
and, as you would hold a light to one in utter darkness&mdash;as you
value your own kindheartedness&mdash;<i>return</i> me an <i>answer</i>,
if but one word, telling me whether I should write on, or write no more.&nbsp;
Forgive undue warmth, because my feelings in this matter cannot be cool;
and believe me, sir, with deep respect,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your really humble servant,<br />
&ldquo;P. B. Bront&euml;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poetry enclosed seems to me by no means equal to parts of the
letter; but, as every one likes to judge for himself, I copy the six
opening stanzas&mdash;about a third of the whole, and certainly not
the worst.</p>
<blockquote><p>So where he reigns in glory bright,<br />
Above those starry skies of night,<br />
Amid his Paradise of light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, why may I not be?</p>
<p>Oft when awake on Christmas morn,<br />
In sleepless twilight laid forlorn,<br />
Strange thoughts have o&rsquo;er my mind been borne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How he has died for me.</p>
<p>And oft within my chamber lying,<br />
Have I awaked myself with crying<br />
From dreams, where I beheld Him dying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the accursed Tree.</p>
<p>And often has my mother said,<br />
While on her lap I laid my head,<br />
She feared for time I was not made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Eternity.</p>
<p>So &ldquo;I can read my title clear,<br />
To mansions in the skies,<br />
And let me bid farewell to fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wipe my weeping eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll lay me down on this marble stone,<br />
And set the world aside,<br />
To see upon her ebon throne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Moon in glory ride.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after Charlotte returned to Dewsbury Moor, she was distressed
by hearing that her friend &ldquo;E.&rdquo; was likely to leave the
neighbourhood for a considerable length of time.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Feb. 20th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do without you?&nbsp; How long are we likely
to be separated?&nbsp; Why are we to be denied each other&rsquo;s society?&nbsp;
It is an inscrutable fatality.&nbsp; I long to be with you, because
it seems as if two or three days, or weeks, spent in your company would
beyond measure strengthen me in the enjoyment of those feelings which
I have so lately begun to cherish.&nbsp; You first pointed out to me
that way in which I am so feebly endeavouring to travel, and now I cannot
keep you by my side, I must proceed sorrowfully alone.&nbsp; Why are
we to be divided?&nbsp; Surely, it must be because we are in danger
of loving each other too well&mdash;of losing sight of the <i>Creator</i>
in idolatry of the <i>creature</i>.&nbsp; At first, I could not say
&lsquo;Thy will be done!&rsquo;&nbsp; I felt rebellious, but I knew
it was wrong to feel so.&nbsp; Being left a moment alone this morning,
I prayed fervently to be enabled to resign myself to <i>every</i> decree
of God&rsquo;s will, though it should be dealt forth by a far severer
hand than the present disappointment; since then I have felt calmer
and humbler, and consequently happier.&nbsp; Last Sunday I took up my
Bible in a gloomy state of mind: I began to read&mdash;a feeling stole
over me such as I have not known for many long years&mdash;a sweet,
placid sensation, like those, I remember, which used to visit me when
I was a little child, and, on Sunday evenings in summer, stood by the
open window reading the life of a certain French nobleman, who attained
a purer and higher degree of sanctity than has been known since the
days of the early martyrs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;E.&rsquo;s&rdquo; residence was equally within a walk from
Dewsbury Moor as it had been from Roe Head; and on Saturday afternoons
both &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and she used to call upon Charlotte, and often
endeavoured to persuade her to return with them, and be the guest of
one of them till Monday morning; but this was comparatively seldom.&nbsp;
Mary says:&mdash;&ldquo;She visited us twice or thrice when she was
at Miss W---&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We used to dispute about politics and religion.&nbsp;
She, a Tory and clergyman&rsquo;s daughter, was always in a minority
of one in our house of violent Dissent and Radicalism.&nbsp; She used
to hear over again, delivered <i>with authority</i>, all the lectures
I had been used to give her at school on despotic aristocracy, mercenary
priesthood, &amp;c.&nbsp; She had not energy to defend herself; sometimes
she owned to a <i>little</i> truth in it, but generally said nothing.&nbsp;
Her feeble health gave her her yielding manner, for she could never
oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle.&nbsp;
Thus she would let me advise and patronise most imperiously, sometimes
picking out any grain of sense there might be in what I said, but never
allowing any one materially to interfere with her independence of thought
and action.&nbsp; Though her silence sometimes left one under the impression
that she agreed when she did not, she never gave a flattering opinion,
and thus her words were golden, whether for praise or blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo; father was a man of remarkable intelligence,
but of strong, not to say violent prejudices, all running in favour
of Republicanism and Dissent.&nbsp; No other county but Yorkshire could
have produced such a man.&nbsp; His brother had been a <i>d&eacute;tenu</i>
in France, and had afterwards voluntarily taken up his residence there.&nbsp;
Mr. T. himself had been much abroad, both on business and to see the
great continental galleries of paintings.&nbsp; He spoke French perfectly,
I have been told, when need was; but delighted usually in talking the
broadest Yorkshire.&nbsp; He bought splendid engravings of the pictures
which he particularly admired, and his house was full of works of art
and of books; but he rather liked to present his rough side to any stranger
or new-comer; he would speak his broadest, bring out his opinions on
Church and State in their most startling forms, and, by and by, if he
found his hearer could stand the shock, he would involuntarily show
his warm kind heart, and his true taste, and real refinement.&nbsp;
His family of four sons and two daughters were brought up on Republican
principles; independence of thought and action was encouraged; no &ldquo;shams&rdquo;
tolerated.&nbsp; They are scattered far and wide: Martha, the younger
daughter, sleeps in the Protestant cemetery at Brussels; Mary is in
New Zealand; Mr. T. is dead.&nbsp; And so life and death have dispersed
the circle of &ldquo;violent Radicals and Dissenters&rdquo; into which,
twenty years ago, the little, quiet, resolute clergyman&rsquo;s daughter
was received, and by whom she was truly loved and honoured.</p>
<p>January and February of 1837 had passed away, and still there was
no reply from Southey.&nbsp; Probably she had lost expectation and almost
hope when at length, in the beginning of March, she received the letter
inserted in Mr. C. C. Southey&rsquo;s life of his Father, vol. iv. p.
327.</p>
<p>After accounting for his delay in replying to hers by the fact of
a long absence from home, during which his letters had accumulated,
whence &ldquo;it has lain unanswered till the last of a numerous file,
not from disrespect or indifference to its contents, but because in
truth it is not an easy task to answer it, nor a pleasant one to cast
a damp over the high spirits and the generous desires of youth,&rdquo;
he goes on to say: &ldquo;What you are I can only infer from your letter,
which appears to be written in sincerity, though I may suspect that
you have used a fictitious signature.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the letter
and the verses bear the same stamp, and I can well understand the state
of mind they indicate.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my advice that you have asked as to the direction
of your talents, but my opinion of them, and yet the opinion may be
worth little, and the advice much.&nbsp; You evidently possess, and
in no inconsiderable degree, what Wordsworth calls the &lsquo;faculty
of verse.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am not depreciating it when I say that in these
times it is not rare.&nbsp; Many volumes of poems are now published
every year without attracting public attention, any one of which if
it had appeared half a century ago, would have obtained a high reputation
for its author.&nbsp; Whoever, therefore, is ambitious of distinction
in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate
this talent, if you consult your own happiness.&nbsp; I, who have made
literature my profession, and devoted my life to it, and have never
for a moment repented of the deliberate choice, think myself, nevertheless,
bound in duty to caution every young man who applies as an aspirant
to me for encouragement and advice, against taking so perilous a course.&nbsp;
You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution; there can be
no peril in it for her.&nbsp; In a certain sense this is true; but there
is a danger of which I would, with all kindness and all earnestness,
warn you.&nbsp; The day dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely
to induce a distempered state of mind; and in proportion as all the
ordinary uses of the world seem to you flat and unprofitable, you will
be unfitted for them without becoming fitted for anything else.&nbsp;
Literature cannot be the business of a woman&rsquo;s life, and it ought
not to be.&nbsp; The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less
leisure will she have for it, even as an accomplishment and a recreation.&nbsp;
To those duties you have not yet been called, and when you are you will
be less eager for celebrity.&nbsp; You will not seek in imagination
for excitement, of which the vicissitudes of this life, and the anxieties
from which you must not hope to be exempted, be your state what it may,
will bring with them but too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do not suppose that I disparage the gift which you possess;
nor that I would discourage you from exercising it.&nbsp; I only exhort
you so to think of it, and so to use it, as to render it conducive to
your own permanent good.&nbsp; Write poetry for its own sake; not in
a spirit of emulation, and not with a view to celebrity; the less you
aim at that the more likely you will be to deserve and finally to obtain
it.&nbsp; So written, it is wholesome both for the heart and soul; it
may be made the surest means, next to religion, of soothing the mind
and elevating it.&nbsp; You may embody in it your best thoughts and
your wisest feelings, and in so doing discipline and strengthen them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, madam.&nbsp; It is not because I have forgotten
that I was once young myself, that I write to you in this strain; but
because I remember it.&nbsp; You will neither doubt my sincerity nor
my good will; and however ill what has here been said may accord with
your present views and temper, the longer you live the more reasonable
it will appear to you.&nbsp; Though I may be but an ungracious adviser,
you will allow me, therefore, to subscribe myself, with the best wishes
for your happiness here and hereafter, your true friend,</p>
<p>&ldquo;ROBERT SOUTHEY.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>I was with Miss Bront&euml; when she received Mr. Cuthbert Southey&rsquo;s
note, requesting her permission to insert the foregoing letter in his
father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; She said to me, &ldquo;Mr. Southey&rsquo;s
letter was kind and admirable; a little stringent, but it did me good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is partly because I think it so admirable, and partly because
it tends to bring out her character, as shown in the following reply,
that I have taken the liberty of inserting the foregoing extracts from
it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir, March 16th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot rest till I have answered your letter, even though
by addressing you a second time I should appear a little intrusive;
but I must thank you for the kind and wise advice you have condescended
to give me.&nbsp; I had not ventured to hope for such a reply; so considerate
in its tone, so noble in its spirit.&nbsp; I must suppress what I feel,
or you will think me foolishly enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the first perusal of your letter, I felt only shame and
regret that I had ever ventured to trouble you with my crude rhapsody;
I felt a painful heat rise to my face when I thought of the quires of
paper I had covered with what once gave me so much delight, but which
now was only a source of confusion; but after I had thought a little
and read it again and again, the prospect seemed to clear.&nbsp; You
do not forbid me to write; you do not say that what I write is utterly
destitute of merit.&nbsp; You only warn me against the folly of neglecting
real duties for the sake of imaginative pleasures; of writing for the
love of fame; for the selfish excitement of emulation.&nbsp; You kindly
allow me to write poetry for its own sake, provided I leave undone nothing
which I ought to do, in order to pursue that single, absorbing, exquisite
gratification.&nbsp; I am afraid, sir, you think me very foolish.&nbsp;
I know the first letter I wrote to you was all senseless trash from
beginning to end; but I am not altogether the idle dreaming being it
would seem to denote.&nbsp; My father is a clergyman of limited, though
competent income, and I am the eldest of his children.&nbsp; He expended
quite as much in my education as he could afford in justice to the rest.&nbsp;
I thought it therefore my duty, when I left school, to become a governess.&nbsp;
In that capacity I find enough to occupy my thoughts all day long, and
my head and hands too, without having a moment&rsquo;s time for one
dream of the imagination.&nbsp; In the evenings, I confess, I do think,
but I never trouble any one else with my thoughts.&nbsp; I carefully
avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity, which might
lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits.&nbsp;
Following my father&rsquo;s advice&mdash;who from my childhood has counselled
me, just in the wise and friendly tone of your letter&mdash;I have endeavoured
not only attentively to observe all the duties a woman ought to fulfil,
but to feel deeply interested in them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t always succeed,
for sometimes when I&rsquo;m teaching or sewing I would rather be reading
or writing; but I try to deny myself; and my father&rsquo;s approbation
amply rewarded me for the privation.&nbsp; Once more allow me to thank
you with sincere gratitude.&nbsp; I trust I shall never more feel ambitious
to see my name in print: if the wish should rise, I&rsquo;ll look at
Southey&rsquo;s letter, and suppress it.&nbsp; It is honour enough for
me that I have written to him, and received an answer.&nbsp; That letter
is consecrated; no one shall ever see it, but papa and my brother and
sisters.&nbsp; Again I thank you.&nbsp; This incident, I suppose, will
be renewed no more; if I live to be an old woman, I shall remember it
thirty years hence as a bright dream.&nbsp; The signature which you
suspected of being fictitious is my real name.&nbsp; Again, therefore,
I must sign myself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;C. Bront&euml;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Pray, sir, excuse me for writing to you a second
time; I could not help writing, partly to tell you how thankful I am
for your kindness, and partly to let you know that your advice shall
not be wasted; however sorrowfully and reluctantly it may be at first
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C. B.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting Southey&rsquo;s
reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Keswick, March 22, 1837.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Madam,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter has given me great pleasure, and I should not
forgive myself if I did not tell you so.&nbsp; You have received admonition
as considerately and as kindly as it was given.&nbsp; Let me now request
that, if you ever should come to these Lakes while I am living here,
you will let me see you.&nbsp; You would then think of me afterwards
with the more good-will, because you would perceive that there is neither
severity nor moroseness in the state of mind to which years and observation
have brought me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, by God&rsquo;s mercy, in our power to attain a degree
of self-government, which is essential to our own happiness, and contributes
greatly to that of those around us.&nbsp; Take care of over-excitement,
and endeavour to keep a quiet mind (even for your health it is the best
advice that can be given you): your moral and spiritual improvement
will then keep pace with the culture of your intellectual powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, madam, God bless you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, and believe me to be your sincere friend,</p>
<p>&ldquo;ROBERT SOUTHEY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of this second letter, also, she spoke, and told me that it contained
an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the
Lakes.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there was no money to spare,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;nor any prospect of my ever earning money enough to have the
chance of so great a pleasure, so I gave up thinking of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At the time we conversed together on the subject we were at the Lakes.&nbsp;
But Southey was dead.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;stringent&rdquo; letter made her put aside, for a time,
all idea of literary enterprise.&nbsp; She bent her whole energy towards
the fulfilment of the duties in hand; but her occupation was not sufficient
food for her great forces of intellect, and they cried out perpetually,
&ldquo;Give, give,&rdquo; while the comparatively less breezy air of
Dewsbury Moor told upon her health and spirits more and more.&nbsp;
On August 27, 1837, she writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am again at Dewsbury, engaged in the old business,&mdash;teach,
teach, teach . . . <i>When will you come home</i>?&nbsp; Make haste!&nbsp;
You have been at Bath long enough for all purposes; by this time you
have acquired polish enough, I am sure; if the varnish is laid on much
thicker, I am afraid the good wood underneath will be quite concealed,
and your Yorkshire friends won&rsquo;t stand that.&nbsp; Come, come.&nbsp;
I am getting really tired of your absence.&nbsp; Saturday after Saturday
comes round, and I can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door,
and then being told that &lsquo;Miss E. is come.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, dear!
in this monotonous life of mine, that was a pleasant event.&nbsp; I
wish it would recur again; but it will take two or three interviews
before the stiffness&mdash;the estrangement of this long separation&mdash;will
wear away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About this time she forgot to return a work-bag she had borrowed,
by a messenger, and in repairing her error she says:&mdash;&ldquo;These
aberrations of memory warn me pretty intelligibly that I am getting
past my prime.&rdquo;&nbsp; AEtat 21!&nbsp; And the same tone of despondency
runs through the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wish exceedingly that I could come to you before
Christmas, but it is impossible; another three weeks must elapse before
I shall again have my comforter beside me, under the roof of my own
dear quiet home.&nbsp; If I could always live with you, and daily read
the Bible with you&mdash;if your lips and mine could at the same time
drink the same draught, from the same pure fountain of mercy&mdash;I
hope, I trust, I might one day become better, far better than my evil,
wandering thoughts, my corrupt heart, cold to the spirit and warm to
the flesh, will now permit me to be.&nbsp; I often plan the pleasant
life which we might lead together, strengthening each other in that
power of self-denial, that hallowed and glowing devotion, which the
first saints of God often attained to.&nbsp; My eyes fill with tears
when I contrast the bliss of such a state, brightened by hopes of the
future, with the melancholy state I now live in, uncertain that I ever
felt true contrition, wandering in thought and deed, longing for holiness,
which I shall <i>never</i>, <i>never</i> obtain, smitten at times to
the heart with the conviction that ghastly Calvinistic doctrines are
true&mdash;darkened, in short, by the very shadows of spiritual death.&nbsp;
If Christian perfection be necessary to salvation, I shall never be
saved; my heart is a very hotbed for sinful thoughts, and when I decide
on an action I scarcely remember to look to my Redeemer for direction.&nbsp;
I know not how to pray; I cannot bend my life to the grand end of doing
good; I go on constantly seeking my own pleasure, pursuing the gratification
of my own desires.&nbsp; I forget God, and will not God forget me?&nbsp;
And, meantime, I know the greatness of Jehovah; I acknowledge the perfection
of His word; I adore the purity of the Christian faith; my theory is
right, my practice horribly wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Christmas holidays came, and she and Anne returned to the parsonage,
and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded;
amongst all other people they shrivelled up more or less.&nbsp; Indeed,
there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the
sisters without producing the same result.&nbsp; Emily and Anne were
bound up in their lives and interests like twins.&nbsp; The former from
reserve, the latter from timidity, avoided all friendships and intimacies
beyond their family.&nbsp; Emily was impervious to influence; she never
came in contact with public opinion, and her own decision of what was
right and fitting was a law for her conduct and appearance, with which
she allowed no one to interfere.&nbsp; Her love was poured out on Anne,
as Charlotte&rsquo;s was on her.&nbsp; But the affection among all the
three was stronger than either death or life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E.&rdquo; was eagerly welcomed by Charlotte, freely admitted
by Emily, and kindly received by Anne, whenever she could visit them;
and this Christmas she had promised to do so, but her coming had to
be delayed on account of a little domestic accident detailed in the
following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dec. 29, 1837.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you will have thought me very remiss in not sending
my promised letter long before now; but I have a sufficient and very
melancholy excuse in an accident that befell our old faithful Tabby,
a few days after my return home.&nbsp; She was gone out into the village
on some errand, when, as she was descending the steep street, her foot
slipped on the ice, and she fell; it was dark, and no one saw her mischance,
till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer-by.&nbsp;
She was lifted up and carried into the druggist&rsquo;s near; and, after
the examination, it was discovered that she had completely shattered
and dislocated one leg.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the fracture could not
be set till six o&rsquo;clock the next morning, as no surgeon was to
be had before that time, and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful
and dangerous state.&nbsp; Of course we are all exceedingly distressed
at the circumstance, for she was like one of our own family.&nbsp; Since
the event we have been almost without assistance&mdash;a person has
dropped in now and then to do the drudgery, but we have as yet been
able to procure no regular servant; and consequently, the whole work
of the house, as well as the additional duty of nursing Tabby, falls
on ourselves.&nbsp; Under these circumstances I dare not press your
visit here, at least until she is pronounced out of danger; it would
be too selfish of me.&nbsp; Aunt wished me to give you this information
before, but papa and all the rest were anxious I should delay until
we saw whether matters took a more settled aspect, and I myself kept
putting it off from day to day, most bitterly reluctant to give up all
the pleasure I had anticipated so long.&nbsp; However, remembering what
you told me, namely, that you had commended the matter to a higher decision
than ours, and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to
that decision, whatever it might be, I hold it my duty to yield also,
and to be silent; it may be all for the best.&nbsp; I fear, if you had
been here during this severe weather, your visit would have been of
no advantage to you, for the moors are blockaded with snow, and you
would never have been able to get out.&nbsp; After this disappointment,
I never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again;
it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me.&nbsp; I am not
good enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of
too intimate society.&nbsp; I would urge your visit yet&mdash;I would
entreat and press it&mdash;but the thought comes across me, should Tabby
die while you are in the house, I should never forgive myself.&nbsp;
No! it must not be, and in a thousand ways the consciousness of that
mortifies and disappoints me most keenly, and I am not the only one
who is disappointed.&nbsp; All in the house were looking to your visit
with eagerness.&nbsp; Papa says he highly approves of my friendship
with you, and he wishes me to continue it through life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good neighbour of the Bront&euml;s&mdash;a clever, intelligent
Yorkshire woman, who keeps a druggist&rsquo;s shop in Haworth, and from
her occupation, her experience, and excellent sense, holds the position
of village doctress and nurse, and, as such, has been a friend, in many
a time of trial, and sickness, and death, in the households round&mdash;told
me a characteristic little incident connected with Tabby&rsquo;s fractured
leg.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; is truly generous and regardful of all deserving
claims.&nbsp; Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years, and
was, as Charlotte expressed it, &ldquo;one of the family.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But on the other hand, she was past the age for any very active service,
being nearer seventy than sixty at the time of the accident; she had
a sister living in the village; and the savings she had accumulated,
during many years&rsquo; service, formed a competency for one in her
rank of life.&nbsp; Or if, in this time of sickness, she fell short
of any comforts which her state rendered necessary, the parsonage could
supply them.&nbsp; So reasoned Miss Branwell, the prudent, not to say
anxious aunt; looking to the limited contents of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
purse, and the unprovided-for-future of her nieces; who were, moreover,
losing the relaxation of the holidays, in close attendance upon Tabby.</p>
<p>Miss Branwell urged her views upon Mr. Bront&euml; as soon as the
immediate danger to the old servant&rsquo;s life was over.&nbsp; He
refused at first to listen to the careful advice; it was repugnant to
his liberal nature.&nbsp; But Miss Branwell persevered; urged economical
motives; pressed on his love for his daughters.&nbsp; He gave way.&nbsp;
Tabby was to be removed to her sister&rsquo;s, and there nursed and
cared for, Mr. Bront&euml; coming in with his aid when her own resources
fell short.&nbsp; This decision was communicated to the girls.&nbsp;
There were symptoms of a quiet, but sturdy rebellion, that winter afternoon,
in the small precincts of Haworth parsonage.&nbsp; They made one unanimous
and stiff remonstrance.&nbsp; Tabby had tended them in their childhood;
they, and none other, should tend her in her infirmity and age.&nbsp;
At tea-time, they were sad and silent, and the meal went away untouched
by any of the three.&nbsp; So it was at breakfast; they did not waste
many words on the subject, but each word they did utter was weighty.&nbsp;
They &ldquo;struck&rdquo; eating till the resolution was rescinded,
and Tabby was allowed to remain a helpless invalid entirely dependent
upon them.&nbsp; Herein was the strong feeling of Duty being paramount
to pleasure, which lay at the foundation of Charlotte&rsquo;s character,
made most apparent; for we have seen how she yearned for her friend&rsquo;s
company; but it was to be obtained only by shrinking from what she esteemed
right, and that she never did, whatever might be the sacrifice.</p>
<p>She had another weight on her mind this Christmas.&nbsp; I have said
that the air of Dewsbury Moor did not agree with her, though she herself
was hardly aware how much her life there was affecting her health.&nbsp;
But Anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays, and Charlotte
watched over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some
wild creature, that changes her very nature if danger threatens her
young.&nbsp; Anne had a slight cough, a pain at her side, a difficulty
of breathing.&nbsp; Miss W--- considered it as little more than a common
cold; but Charlotte felt every indication of incipient consumption as
a stab at her heart, remembering Maria and Elizabeth, whose places once
knew them, and should know them no more.</p>
<p>Stung by anxiety for this little sister, she upbraided Miss W---
for her fancied indifference to Anne&rsquo;s state of health.&nbsp;
Miss W--- felt these reproaches keenly, and wrote to Mr. Bront&euml;
about them.&nbsp; He immediately replied most kindly, expressing his
fear that Charlotte&rsquo;s apprehensions and anxieties respecting her
sister had led her to give utterance to over-excited expressions of
alarm.&nbsp; Through Miss W---&rsquo;s kind consideration, Anne was
a year longer at school than her friends intended.&nbsp; At the close
of the half-year Miss W--- sought for the opportunity of an explanation
of each other&rsquo;s words, and the issue proved that &ldquo;the falling
out of faithful friends, renewing is of love.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so ended
the first, last, and only difference Charlotte ever had with good, kind
Miss W ---.</p>
<p>Still her heart had received a shock in the perception of Anne&rsquo;s
delicacy; and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing,
fond anxiety, which is so full of sudden pangs of fear.</p>
<p>Emily had given up her situation in the Halifax school, at the expiration
of six months of arduous trial, on account of her health, which could
only be re-established by the bracing moorland air and free life of
home.&nbsp; Tabby&rsquo;s illness had preyed on the family resources.&nbsp;
I doubt whether Branwell was maintaining himself at this time.&nbsp;
For some unexplained reason, he had given up the idea of becoming a
student of painting at the Royal Academy, and his prospects in life
were uncertain, and had yet to be settled.&nbsp; So Charlotte had quietly
to take up her burden of teaching again, and return to her previous
monotonous life.</p>
<p>Brave heart, ready to die in harness!&nbsp; She went back to her
work, and made no complaint, hoping to subdue the weakness that was
gaining ground upon her.&nbsp; About this time, she would turn sick
and trembling at any sudden noise, and could hardly repress her screams
when startled.&nbsp; This showed a fearful degree of physical weakness
in one who was generally so self-controlled; and the medical man, whom
at length, through Miss W---&rsquo;s entreaty, she was led to consult,
insisted on her return to the parsonage.&nbsp; She had led too sedentary
a life, he said; and the soft summer air, blowing round her home, the
sweet company of those she loved, the release, the freedom of life in
her own family, were needed, to save either reason or life.&nbsp; So,
as One higher than she had over-ruled that for a time she might relax
her strain, she returned to Haworth; and after a season of utter quiet,
her father sought for her the enlivening society of her two friends,
Mary and Martha T.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the following letter,
written to the then absent E., there is, I think, as pretty a glimpse
of a merry group of young people as need be; and like all descriptions
of doing, as distinct from thinking or feeling, in letters, it saddens
one in proportion to the vivacity of the picture of what was once, and
is now utterly swept away.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Haworth, June 9, 1838.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I received your packet of despatches on Wednesday; it was
brought me by Mary and Martha, who have been staying at Haworth for
a few days; they leave us to-day.&nbsp; You will be surprised at the
date of this letter.&nbsp; I ought to be at Dewsbury Moor, you know;
but I stayed as long as I was able, and at length I neither could nor
dared stay any longer.&nbsp; My health and spirits had utterly failed
me, and the medical man whom I consulted enjoined me, as I valued my
life, to go home.&nbsp; So home I went, and the change has at once roused
and soothed me; and I am now, I trust, fairly in the way to be myself
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A calm and even mind like yours cannot conceive the feelings
of the shattered wretch who is now writing to you, when, after weeks
of mental and bodily anguish not to be described, something like peace
began to dawn again.&nbsp; Mary is far from well.&nbsp; She breathes
short, has a pain in her chest, and frequent flushings of fever.&nbsp;
I cannot tell you what agony these symptoms give me; they remind me
too strongly of my two sisters, whom no power of medicine could save.&nbsp;
Martha is now very well; she has kept in a continual flow of good humour
during her stay here, and has consequently been very fascinating . .
. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are making such a noise about me I cannot write any more.&nbsp;
Mary is playing on the piano; Martha is chattering as fast as her little
tongue can run; and Branwell is standing before her, laughing at her
vivacity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte grew much stronger in this quiet, happy period at home.&nbsp;
She paid occasional visits to her two great friends, and they in return
came to Haworth.&nbsp; At one of their houses, I suspect, she met with
the person to whom the following letter refers&mdash;some one having
a slight resemblance to the character of &ldquo;St. John,&rdquo; in
the last volume of &ldquo;Jane Eyre,&rdquo; and, like him, in holy orders.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March 12, 1839.</p>
<p>. . . &ldquo;I had a kindly leaning towards him, because he is an
amiable and well-disposed man.&nbsp; Yet I had not, and could not have,
that intense attachment which would make me willing to die for him;
and if ever I marry, it must be in that light of adoration that I will
regard my husband.&nbsp; Ten to one I shall never have the chance again;
but <i>n&rsquo;importe</i>.&nbsp; Moreover, I was aware that he knew
so little of me he could hardly be conscious to whom he was writing.&nbsp;
Why! it would startle him to see me in my natural home character; he
would think I was a wild, romantic enthusiast indeed.&nbsp; I could
not sit all day long making a grave face before my husband.&nbsp; I
would laugh, and satirize, and say whatever came into my head first.&nbsp;
And if he were a clever man, and loved me, the whole world, weighed
in the balance against his smallest wish, should be light as air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&mdash;her first proposal of marriage&mdash;was quietly declined
and put on one side.&nbsp; Matrimony did not enter into the scheme of
her life, but good, sound, earnest labour did; the question, however,
was as yet undecided in what direction she should employ her forces.&nbsp;
She had been discouraged in literature; her eyes failed her in the minute
kind of drawing which she practised when she wanted to express an idea;
teaching seemed to her at this time, as it does to most women at all
times, the only way of earning an independent livelihood.&nbsp; But
neither she nor her sisters were naturally fond of children.&nbsp; The
hieroglyphics of childhood were an unknown language to them, for they
had never been much with those younger than themselves.&nbsp; I am inclined
to think, too, that they had not the happy knack of imparting information,
which seems to be a separate gift from the faculty of acquiring it;
a kind of sympathetic tact, which instinctively perceives the difficulties
that impede comprehension in a child&rsquo;s mind, and that yet are
too vague and unformed for it, with its half-developed powers of expression,
to explain by words.&nbsp; Consequently, teaching very young children
was anything but a &ldquo;delightful task&rdquo; to the three Bront&euml;
sisters.&nbsp; With older girls, verging on womanhood, they might have
done better, especially if these had any desire for improvement.&nbsp;
But the education which the village clergyman&rsquo;s daughters had
received, did not as yet qualify them to undertake the charge of advanced
pupils.&nbsp; They knew but little French, and were not proficients
in music; I doubt whether Charlotte could play at all.&nbsp; But they
were all strong again, and, at any rate, Charlotte and Anne must put
their shoulders to the wheel.&nbsp; One daughter was needed at home,
to stay with Mr. Bront&euml; and Miss Branwell; to be the young and
active member in a household of four, whereof three&mdash;the father,
the aunt, and faithful Tabby&mdash;were past middle age.&nbsp; And Emily,
who suffered and drooped more than her sisters when away from Haworth,
was the one appointed to remain.&nbsp; Anne was the first to meet with
a situation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;April 15th, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not write to you in the week you requested, as about
that time we were very busy in preparing for Anne&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp;
Poor child! she left us last Monday; no one went with her; it was her
own wish that she might be allowed to go alone, as she thought she could
manage better and summon more courage if thrown entirely upon her own
resources.&nbsp; We have had one letter from her since she went.&nbsp;
She expresses herself very well satisfied, and says that Mrs. --- is
extremely kind; the two eldest children alone are under her care, the
rest are confined to the nursery, with which and its occupants she has
nothing to do . . . I hope she&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; You would be astonished
what a sensible, clever letter she writes; it is only the talking part
that I fear.&nbsp; But I do seriously apprehend that Mrs. --- will sometimes
conclude that she has a natural impediment in her speech.&nbsp; For
my own part, I am as yet &lsquo;wanting a situation,&rsquo; like a housemaid
out of place.&nbsp; By the way, I have lately discovered I have quite
a talent for cleaning, sweeping up hearths, dusting rooms, making beds,
&amp;c.; so, if everything else fails, I can turn my hand to that, if
anybody will give me good wages for little labour.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
be a cook; I hate soothing.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be a nurserymaid, nor
a lady&rsquo;s-maid, far less a lady&rsquo;s companion, or a mantua-maker,
or a straw-bonnet maker, or a taker-in of plain work.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
be anything but a housemaid . . . With regard to my visit to G., I have
as yet received no invitation; but if I should be asked, though I should
feel it a great act of self-denial to refuse, yet I have almost made
up my mind to do so, though the society of the T.&rsquo;s is one of
the most rousing pleasures I have ever known.&nbsp; Good-bye, my darling
E., &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;Strike out that word &lsquo;darling;&rsquo; it
is humbug.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the use of protestations?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
known each other, and liked each other, a good while; that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not many weeks after this was written, Charlotte also became engaged
as a governess.&nbsp; I intend carefully to abstain from introducing
the names of any living people, respecting whom I may have to tell unpleasant
truths, or to quote severe remarks from Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s letters;
but it is necessary that the difficulties she had to encounter in her
various phases of life, should be fairly and frankly made known, before
the force &ldquo;of what was resisted&rdquo; can be at all understood.&nbsp;
I was once speaking to her about &ldquo;Agnes Grey&rdquo;&mdash;the
novel in which her sister Anne pretty literally describes her own experience
as a governess&mdash;and alluding more particularly to the account of
the stoning of the little nestlings in the presence of the parent birds.&nbsp;
She said that none but those who had been in the position of a governess
could ever realise the dark side of &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; human
nature; under no great temptation to crime, but daily giving way to
selfishness and ill-temper, till its conduct towards those dependent
on it sometimes amounts to a tyranny of which one would rather be the
victim than the inflicter.&nbsp; We can only trust in such cases that
the employers err rather from a density of perception and an absence
of sympathy, than from any natural cruelty of disposition.&nbsp; Among
several things of the same kind, which I well remember, she told me
what had once occurred to herself.&nbsp; She had been entrusted with
the care of a little boy, three or four years old, during the absence
of his parents on a day&rsquo;s excursion, and particularly enjoined
to keep him out of the stable-yard.&nbsp; His elder brother, a lad of
eight or nine, and not a pupil of Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s, tempted
the little fellow into the forbidden place.&nbsp; She followed, and
tried to induce him to come away; but, instigated by his brother, he
began throwing stones at her, and one of them hit her so severe a blow
on the temple that the lads were alarmed into obedience.&nbsp; The next
day, in full family conclave, the mother asked Miss Bront&euml; what
occasioned the mark on her forehead.&nbsp; She simply replied, &ldquo;An
accident, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and no further inquiry was made; but the
children (both brothers and sisters) had been present, and honoured
her for not &ldquo;telling tales.&rdquo;&nbsp; From that time, she began
to obtain influence over all, more or less, according to their different
characters; and as she insensibly gained their affection, her own interest
in them was increasing.&nbsp; But one day, at the children&rsquo;s dinner,
the small truant of the stable-yard, in a little demonstrative gush,
said, putting his hand in hers, &ldquo;I love &lsquo;ou, Miss Bront&euml;.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon, the mother exclaimed, before all the children, &ldquo;Love
the <i>governess</i>, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family into which she first entered was, I believe, that
of a wealthy Yorkshire manufacturer.&nbsp; The following extracts from
her correspondence at this time will show how painfully the restraint
of her new mode of life pressed upon her.&nbsp; The first is from a
letter to Emily, beginning with one of the tender expressions in which,
in spite of &lsquo;humbug,&rsquo; she indulged herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mine
dear love,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mine-bonnie love,&rsquo; are her terms of address
to this beloved sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June 8th, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have striven hard to be pleased with my new situation.&nbsp;
The country, the house and the grounds are, as I have said, divine;
but, alack-a-day! there is such a thing as seeing all beautiful around
you&mdash;pleasant woods, white paths, green lawns, and blue sunshiny
sky&mdash;and not having a free moment or a free thought left to enjoy
them.&nbsp; The children are constantly with me.&nbsp; As for correcting
them, I quickly found that was out of the question; they are to do as
they like.&nbsp; A complaint to the mother only brings black looks on
myself, and unjust, partial excuses to screen the children.&nbsp; I
have tried that plan once, and succeeded so notably, I shall try no
more.&nbsp; I said in my last letter that Mrs. --- did not know me.&nbsp;
I now begin to find she does not intend to know me; that she cares nothing
about me, except to contrive how the greatest possible quantity of labour
may be got out of me; and to that end she overwhelms me with oceans
of needle-work; yards of cambric to hem, muslin nightcaps to make, and,
above all things, dolls to dress.&nbsp; I do not think she likes me
at all, because I can&rsquo;t help being shy in such an entirely novel
scene, surrounded as I have hitherto been by strange and constantly
changing faces . . . I used to think I should like to be in the stir
of grand folks&rsquo; society; but I have had enough of it&mdash;it
is dreary work to look on and listen.&nbsp; I see more clearly than
I have ever done before, that a private governess has no existence,
is not considered as a living rational being, except as connected with
the wearisome duties she has to fulfil . . . One of the pleasantest
afternoons I have spent here&mdash;indeed, the only one at all pleasant&mdash;was
when Mr. --- walked out with his children, and I had orders to follow
a little behind.&nbsp; As he strolled on through his fields, with his
magnificent Newfoundland dog at his side, he looked very like what a
frank, wealthy, Conservative gentleman ought to be.&nbsp; He spoke freely
and unaffectedly to the people he met, and, though he indulged his children
and allowed them to tease himself far too much, he would not suffer
them grossly to insult others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(WRITTEN IN PENCIL TO A FRIEND.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;July, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot procure ink, without going into the drawing-room,
where I do not wish to go . . . I should have written to you long since,
and told you every detail of the utterly new scene into which I have
lately been cast, had I not been daily expecting a letter from yourself,
and wondering and lamenting that you did not write; for you will remember
it was your turn.&nbsp; I must not bother you too much with my sorrows,
of which, I fear, you have heard an exaggerated account.&nbsp; If you
were near me, perhaps I might be tempted to tell you all, to grow egotistical,
and pour out the long history of a private governess&rsquo;s trials
and crosses in her first situation.&nbsp; As it is, I will only ask
you to imagine the miseries of a reserved wretch like me, thrown at
once into the midst of a large family, at a time when they were particularly
gay&mdash;when the house was filled with company&mdash;all strangers&mdash;people
whose faces I had never seen before.&nbsp; In this state I had charge
given me of a set of pampered, spoilt, turbulent children, whom I was
expected constantly to amuse, as well as to instruct.&nbsp; I soon found
that the constant demand on my stock of animal spirits reduced them
to the lowest state of exhaustion; at times I felt&mdash;and, I suppose,
seemed&mdash;depressed.&nbsp; To my astonishment, I was taken to task
on the subject by Mrs. --- with a sternness of manner and a harshness
of language scarcely credible; like a fool, I cried most bitterly.&nbsp;
I could not help it; my spirits quite failed me at first.&nbsp; I thought
I had done my best&mdash;strained every nerve to please her; and to
be treated in that way, merely because I was shy and sometimes melancholy,
was too bad.&nbsp; At first I was for giving all up and going home.&nbsp;
But, after a little reflection, I determined to summon what energy I
had, and to weather the storm.&nbsp; I said to myself, &lsquo;I have
never yet quitted a place without gaining a friend; adversity is a good
school; the poor are born to labour, and the dependent to endure.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I resolved to be patient, to command my feelings, and to take what came;
the ordeal, I reflected, would not last many weeks, and I trusted it
would do me good.&nbsp; I recollected the fable of the willow and the
oak; I bent quietly, and now, I trust, the storm is blowing over me.&nbsp;
Mrs. --- is generally considered an agreeable woman; so she is, I doubt
not, in general society.&nbsp; She behaves somewhat more civilly to
me now than she did at first, and the children are a little more manageable;
but she does not know my character, and she does not wish to know it.&nbsp;
I have never had five minutes&rsquo; conversation with her since I came,
except while she was scolding me.&nbsp; I have no wish to be pitied,
except by yourself; if I were talking to you I could tell you much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(TO EMILY, ABOUT THIS TIME.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine bonnie love, I was as glad of your letter as tongue can
express: it is a real, genuine pleasure to hear from home; a thing to
be saved till bedtime, when one has a moment&rsquo;s quiet and rest
to enjoy it thoroughly.&nbsp; Write whenever you can.&nbsp; I could
like to be at home.&nbsp; I could like to work in a mill.&nbsp; I could
like to feel some mental liberty.&nbsp; I could like this weight of
restraint to be taken off.&nbsp; But the holidays will come.&nbsp; Coraggio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her temporary engagement in this uncongenial family ended in the
July of this year; not before the constant strain upon her spirits and
strength had again affected her health; but when this delicacy became
apparent in palpitations and shortness of breathing, it was treated
as affectation&mdash;as a phase of imaginary indisposition, which could
be dissipated by a good scolding.&nbsp; She had been brought up rather
in a school of Spartan endurance than in one of maudlin self-indulgence,
and could bear many a pain and relinquish many a hope in silence.</p>
<p>After she had been at home about a week, her friend proposed that
she should accompany her in some little excursion, having pleasure alone
for its object.&nbsp; She caught at the idea most eagerly at first;
but her hope stood still, waned, and had almost disappeared before,
after many delays, it was realised.&nbsp; In its fulfilment at last,
it was a favourable specimen of many a similar air-bubble dancing before
her eyes in her brief career, in which stern realities, rather than
pleasures, formed the leading incidents.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;July 26th, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your proposal has almost driven me &lsquo;clean daft&rsquo;&mdash;if
you don&rsquo;t understand that ladylike expression, you must ask me
what it means when I see you.&nbsp; The fact is, an excursion with you
anywhere,&mdash;whether to Cleathorpe or Canada,&mdash;just by ourselves,
would be to me most delightful.&nbsp; I should, indeed, like to go;
but I can&rsquo;t get leave of absence for longer than a week, and I&rsquo;m
afraid that would not suit you&mdash;must I then give it up entirely?&nbsp;
I feel as if I <i>could not</i>; I never had such a chance of enjoyment
before; I do want to see you and talk to you, and be with you.&nbsp;
When do you wish to go?&nbsp; Could I meet you at Leeds?&nbsp; To take
a gig from Haworth to B., would be to me a very serious increase of
expense, and I happen to be very low in cash.&nbsp; Oh! rich people
seem to have many pleasures at their command which we are debarred from!&nbsp;
However, no repining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say when you go, and I shall be able in my answer to say decidedly
whether I can accompany you or not.&nbsp; I must&mdash;I will&mdash;I&rsquo;m
set upon it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be obstinate and bear down all opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above, I find that aunt and papa
have determined to go to Liverpool for a fortnight, and take us all
with them.&nbsp; It is stipulated, however, that I should give up the
Cleathorpe scheme.&nbsp; I yield reluctantly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fancy that, about this time, Mr. Bront&euml; found it necessary,
either from failing health or the increased populousness of the parish,
to engage the assistance of a curate.&nbsp; At least, it is in a letter
written this summer that I find mention of the first of a succession
of curates, who henceforward revolved round Haworth Parsonage, and made
an impression on the mind of one of its inmates which she has conveyed
pretty distinctly to the world.&nbsp; The Haworth curate brought his
clerical friends and neighbours about the place, and for a time the
incursions of these, near the parsonage tea-time, formed occurrences
by which the quietness of the life there was varied, sometimes pleasantly,
sometimes disagreeably.&nbsp; The little adventure recorded at the end
of the following letter is uncommon in the lot of most women, and is
a testimony in this case to the unusual power of attraction&mdash;though
so plain in feature&mdash;which Charlotte possessed, when she let herself
go in the happiness and freedom of home.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;August 4th, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Liverpool journey is yet a matter of talk, a sort of castle
in the air; but, between you and me, I fancy it is very doubtful whether
it will ever assume a more solid shape.&nbsp; Aunt&mdash;like many other
elderly people&mdash;likes to talk of such things; but when it comes
to putting them into actual execution, she rather falls off.&nbsp; Such
being the case, I think you and I had better adhere to our first plan
of going somewhere together independently of other people.&nbsp; I have
got leave to accompany you for a week&mdash;at the utmost a fortnight&mdash;but
no more.&nbsp; Where do you wish to go?&nbsp; Burlington, I should think,
from what M. says, would be as eligible a place as any.&nbsp; When do
you set off?&nbsp; Arrange all these things according to your convenience;
I shall start no objections.&nbsp; The idea of seeing the sea&mdash;of
being near it&mdash;watching its changes by sunrise, sunset, moonlight,
and noon-day&mdash;in calm, perhaps in storm&mdash;fills and satisfies
my mind.&nbsp; I shall be discontented at nothing.&nbsp; And then I
am not to be with a set of people with whom I have nothing in common&mdash;who
would be nuisances and bores: but with you, whom I like and know, and
who knows me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an odd circumstance to relate to you: prepare for a
hearty laugh!&nbsp; The other day, Mr. ---, a vicar, came to spend the
day with us, bringing with him his own curate.&nbsp; The latter gentleman,
by name Mr. B., is a young Irish clergyman, fresh from Dublin University.&nbsp;
It was the first time we had any of us seen him, but, however, after
the manner of his countrymen, he soon made himself at home.&nbsp; His
character quickly appeared in his conversation; witty, lively, ardent,
clever too; but deficient in the dignity and discretion of an Englishman.&nbsp;
At home, you know, I talk with ease, and am never shy&mdash;never weighed
down and oppressed by that miserable <i>mauvaise honte</i> which torments
and constrains me elsewhere.&nbsp; So I conversed with this Irishman,
and laughed at his jests; and, though I saw faults in his character,
excused them because of the amusement his originality afforded.&nbsp;
I cooled a little, indeed, and drew in towards the latter part of the
evening, because he began to season his conversation with something
of Hibernian flattery, which I did not quite relish.&nbsp; However,
they went away, and no more was thought about them.&nbsp; A few days
after, I got a letter, the direction of which puzzled me, it being in
a hand I was not accustomed to see.&nbsp; Evidently, it was neither
from you nor Mary, my only correspondents.&nbsp; Having opened and read
it, it proved to be a declaration of attachment and proposal of matrimony,
expressed in the ardent language of the sapient young Irishman!&nbsp;
I hope you are laughing heartily.&nbsp; This is not like one of my adventures,
is it?&nbsp; It more nearly resembles Martha&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I am certainly
doomed to be an old maid.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; I made up my mind
to that fate ever since I was twelve years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! thought I, I have heard of love at first sight, but
this beats all!&nbsp; I leave you to guess what my answer would be,
convinced that you will not do me the injustice of guessing wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 14th of August she still writes from Haworth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have in vain packed my box, and prepared everything
for our anticipated journey.&nbsp; It so happens that I can get no conveyance
this week or the next.&nbsp; The only gig let out to hire in Haworth,
is at Harrowgate, and likely to remain there, for aught I can hear.&nbsp;
Papa decidedly objects to my going by the coach, and walking to B.,
though I am sure I could manage it.&nbsp; Aunt exclaims against the
weather, and the roads, and the four winds of heaven, so I am in a fix,
and, what is worse, so are you.&nbsp; On reading over, for the second
or third time, your last letter (which, by the by, was written in such
hieroglyphics that, at the first hasty perusal, I could hardly make
out two consecutive words), I find you intimate that if I leave this
journey till Thursday I shall be too late.&nbsp; I grieve that I should
have so inconvenienced you; but I need not talk of either Friday or
Saturday now, for I rather imagine there is small chance of my ever
going at all.&nbsp; The elders of the house have never cordially acquiesced
in the measure; and now that impediments seem to start up at every step,
opposition grows more open.&nbsp; Papa, indeed, would willingly indulge
me, but this very kindness of his makes me doubt whether I ought to
draw upon it; so, though I could battle out aunt&rsquo;s discontent,
I yield to papa&rsquo;s indulgence.&nbsp; He does not say so, but I
know he would rather I stayed at home; and aunt meant well too, I dare
say, but I am provoked that she reserved the expression of her decided
disapproval till all was settled between you and myself.&nbsp; Reckon
on me no more; leave me out in your calculations: perhaps I ought, in
the beginning, to have had prudence sufficient to shut my eyes against
such a prospect of pleasure, so as to deny myself the hope of it.&nbsp;
Be as angry as you please with me for disappointing you.&nbsp; I did
not intend it, and have only one thing more to say&mdash;if you do not
go immediately to the sea, will you come to see us at Haworth?&nbsp;
This invitation is not mine only, but papa&rsquo;s and aunt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a little more patience, a little more delay, and she enjoyed
the pleasure she had wished for so much.&nbsp; She and her friend went
to Easton for a fortnight in the latter part of September.&nbsp; It
was here she received her first impressions of the sea.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oct. 24th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten the sea by this time, E.?&nbsp; Is it grown
dim in your mind?&nbsp; Or can you still see it, dark, blue, and green,
and foam-white, and hear it roaring roughly when the wind is high, or
rushing softly when it is calm? . . . I am as well as need be, and very
fat.&nbsp; I think of Easton very often, and of worthy Mr. H., and his
kind-hearted helpmate, and of our pleasant walks to H--- Wood, and to
Boynton, our merry evenings, our romps with little Hancheon, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&nbsp; If we both live, this period of our lives will long be
a theme for pleasant recollection.&nbsp; Did you chance, in your letter
to Mr. H., to mention my spectacles?&nbsp; I am sadly inconvenienced
by the want of them.&nbsp; I can neither read, write, nor draw with
comfort in their absence.&nbsp; I hope Madame won&rsquo;t refuse to
give them up . . . Excuse the brevity of this letter, for I have been
drawing all day, and my eyes are so tired it is quite a labour to write.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as the vivid remembrance of this pleasure died away, an accident
occurred to make the actual duties of life press somewhat heavily for
a time.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;December 21st, 1839</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are at present, and have been during the last month, rather
busy, as, for that space of time, we have been without a servant, except
a little girl to run errands.&nbsp; Poor Tabby became so lame that she
was at length obliged to leave us.&nbsp; She is residing with her sister,
in a little house of her own, which she bought with her savings a year
or two since.&nbsp; She is very comfortable, and wants nothing; as she
is near, we see her very often.&nbsp; In the meantime, Emily and I are
sufficiently busy, as you may suppose: I manage the ironing, and keep
the rooms clean; Emily does the baking, and attends to the kitchen.&nbsp;
We are such odd animals, that we prefer this mode of contrivance to
having a new face amongst us.&nbsp; Besides, we do not despair of Tabby&rsquo;s
return, and she shall not be supplanted by a stranger in her absence.&nbsp;
I excited aunt&rsquo;s wrath very much by burning the clothes, the first
time I attempted to iron; but I do better now.&nbsp; Human feelings
are queer things; I am much happier black-leading the stoves, making
the beds, and sweeping the floors at home, than I should be living like
a fine lady anywhere else.&nbsp; I must indeed drop my subscription
to the Jews, because I have no money to keep it up.&nbsp; I ought to
have announced this intention to you before, but I quite forgot I was
a subscriber.&nbsp; I intend to force myself to take another situation
when I can get one, though I <i>hate</i> and <i>abhor</i> the very thoughts
of governess-ship.&nbsp; But I must do it; and, therefore, I heartily
wish I could hear of a family where they need such a commodity as a
governess.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>The year 1840 found all the Bront&euml;s living at home, except Anne.&nbsp;
As I have already intimated, for some reason with which I am unacquainted,
the plan of sending Branwell to study at the Royal Academy had been
relinquished; probably it was found, on inquiry, that the expenses of
such a life, were greater than his father&rsquo;s slender finances could
afford, even with the help which Charlotte&rsquo;s labours at Miss W---&rsquo;s
gave, by providing for Anne&rsquo;s board and education.&nbsp; I gather
from what I have heard, that Branwell must have been severely disappointed
when the plan fell through.&nbsp; His talents were certainly very brilliant,
and of this he was fully conscious, and fervently desired, by their
use, either in writing or drawing, to make himself a name.&nbsp; At
the same time, he would probably have found his strong love of pleasure
and irregular habits a great impediment in his path to fame; but these
blemishes in his character were only additional reasons why he yearned
after a London life, in which he imagined he could obtain every stimulant
to his already vigorous intellect, while at the same time he would have
a license of action to be found only in crowded cities.&nbsp; Thus his
whole nature was attracted towards the metropolis; and many an hour
must he have spent poring over the map of London, to judge from an anecdote
which has been told me.&nbsp; Some traveller for a London house of business
came to Haworth for a night; and according to the unfortunate habit
of the place, the brilliant &ldquo;Patrick&rdquo; was sent for to the
inn, to beguile the evening by his intellectual conversation and his
flashes of wit.&nbsp; They began to talk of London; of the habits and
ways of life there; of the places of amusement; and Branwell informed
the Londoner of one or two short cuts from point to point, up narrow
lanes or back streets; and it was only towards the end of the evening
that the traveller discovered, from his companion&rsquo;s voluntary
confession, that he had never set foot in London at all.</p>
<p>At this time the young man seemed to have his fate in his own hands.&nbsp;
He was full of noble impulses, as well as of extraordinary gifts; not
accustomed to resist temptation, it is true, from any higher motive
than strong family affection, but showing so much power of attachment
to all about him that they took pleasure in believing that, after a
time, he would &ldquo;right himself,&rdquo; and that they should have
pride and delight in the use he would then make of his splendid talents.&nbsp;
His aunt especially made him her great favourite.&nbsp; There are always
peculiar trials in the life of an only boy in a family of girls.&nbsp;
He is expected to act a part in life; to <i>do</i>, while they are only
to <i>be</i>; and the necessity of their giving way to him in some things,
is too often exaggerated into their giving way to him in all, and thus
rendering him utterly selfish.&nbsp; In the family about whom I am writing,
while the rest were almost ascetic in their habits, Branwell was allowed
to grow up self-indulgent; but, in early youth, his power of attracting
and attaching people was so great, that few came in contact with him
who were not so much dazzled by him as to be desirous of gratifying
whatever wishes he expressed.&nbsp; Of course, he was careful enough
not to reveal anything before his father and sisters of the pleasures
he indulged in; but his tone of thought and conversation became gradually
coarser, and, for a time, his sisters tried to persuade themselves that
such coarseness was a part of manliness, and to blind themselves by
love to the fact that Branwell was worse than other young men.&nbsp;
At present, though he had, they were aware, fallen into some errors,
the exact nature of which they avoided knowing, still he was their hope
and their darling; their pride, who should some time bring great glory
to the name of Bront&euml;.</p>
<p>He and his sister Charlotte were both slight and small of stature,
while the other two were of taller and larger make.&nbsp; I have seen
Branwell&rsquo;s profile; it is what would be generally esteemed very
handsome; the forehead is massive, the eye well set, and the expression
of it fine and intellectual; the nose too is good; but there are coarse
lines about the mouth, and the lips, though of handsome shape, are loose
and thick, indicating self-indulgence, while the slightly retreating
chin conveys an idea of weakness of will.&nbsp; His hair and complexion
were sandy.&nbsp; He had enough of Irish blood in him to make his manners
frank and genial, with a kind of natural gallantry about them.&nbsp;
In a fragment of one of his manuscripts which I have read, there is
a justness and felicity of expression which is very striking.&nbsp;
It is the beginning of a tale, and the actors in it are drawn with much
of the grace of characteristic portrait-painting, in perfectly pure
and simple language which distinguishes so many of Addison&rsquo;s papers
in the &ldquo;Spectator.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fragment is too short to afford
the means of judging whether he had much dramatic talent, as the persons
of the story are not thrown into conversation.&nbsp; But altogether
the elegance and composure of style are such as one would not have expected
from this vehement and ill-fated young man.&nbsp; He had a stronger
desire for literary fame burning in his heart, than even that which
occasionally flashed up in his sisters&rsquo;.&nbsp; He tried various
outlets for his talents.&nbsp; He wrote and sent poems to Wordsworth
and Coleridge, who both expressed kind and laudatory opinions, and he
frequently contributed verses to the <i>Leeds Mercury</i>.&nbsp; In
1840, he was living at home, employing himself in occasional composition
of various kinds, and waiting till some occupation, for which he might
be fitted without any expensive course of preliminary training, should
turn up; waiting, not impatiently; for he saw society of one kind (probably
what he called &ldquo;life&rdquo;) at the Black Bull; and at home he
was as yet the cherished favourite.</p>
<p>Miss Branwell was unaware of the fermentation of unoccupied talent
going on around her.&nbsp; She was not her nieces&rsquo; confidante&mdash;perhaps
no one so much older could have been; but their father, from whom they
derived not a little of their adventurous spirit, was silently cognisant
of much of which she took no note.&nbsp; Next to her nephew, the docile,
pensive Anne was her favourite.&nbsp; Of her she had taken charge from
her infancy; she was always patient and tractable, and would submit
quietly to occasional oppression, even when she felt it keenly.&nbsp;
Not so her two elder sisters; they made their opinions known, when roused
by any injustice.&nbsp; At such times, Emily would express herself as
strongly as Charlotte, although perhaps less frequently.&nbsp; But,
in general, notwithstanding that Miss Branwell might be occasionally
unreasonable, she and her nieces went on smoothly enough; and though
they might now and then be annoyed by petty tyranny, she still inspired
them with sincere respect, and not a little affection.&nbsp; They were,
moreover, grateful to her for many habits she had enforced upon them,
and which in time had become second nature: order, method, neatness
in everything; a perfect knowledge of all kinds of household work; an
exact punctuality, and obedience to the laws of time and place, of which
no one but themselves, I have heard Charlotte say, could tell the value
in after-life; with their impulsive natures, it was positive repose
to have learnt implicit obedience to external laws.&nbsp; People in
Haworth have assured me that, according to the hour of day&mdash;nay,
the very minute&mdash;could they have told what the inhabitants of the
parsonage were about.&nbsp; At certain times the girls would be sewing
in their aunt&rsquo;s bedroom&mdash;the chamber which, in former days,
before they had outstripped her in their learning, had served them as
a schoolroom; at certain (early) hours they had their meals; from six
to eight, Miss Branwell read aloud to Mr. Bront&euml;; at punctual eight,
the household assembled to evening prayers in his study; and by nine
he, the aunt, and Tabby, were all in bed,&mdash;the girls free to pace
up and down (like restless wild animals) in the parlour, talking over
plans and projects, and thoughts of what was to be their future life.</p>
<p>At the time of which I write, the favourite idea was that of keeping
a school.&nbsp; They thought that, by a little contrivance, and a very
little additional building, a small number of pupils, four or six, might
be accommodated in the parsonage.&nbsp; As teaching seemed the only
profession open to them, and as it appeared that Emily at least could
not live away from home, while the others also suffered much from the
same cause, this plan of school-keeping presented itself as most desirable.&nbsp;
But it involved some outlay; and to this their aunt was averse.&nbsp;
Yet there was no one to whom they could apply for a loan of the requisite
means, except Miss Branwell, who had made a small store out of her savings,
which she intended for her nephew and nieces eventually, but which she
did not like to risk.&nbsp; Still, this plan of school-keeping remained
uppermost; and in the evenings of this winter of 1839-40, the alterations
that would be necessary in the house, and the best way of convincing
their aunt of the wisdom of their project, formed the principal subject
of their conversation.</p>
<p>This anxiety weighed upon their minds rather heavily, during the
months of dark and dreary weather.&nbsp; Nor were external events, among
the circle of their friends, of a cheerful character.&nbsp; In January,
1840, Charlotte heard of the death of a young girl who had been a pupil
of hers, and a schoolfellow of Anne&rsquo;s, at the time when the sisters
were together at Roe Head; and had attached herself very strongly to
the latter, who, in return, bestowed upon her much quiet affection.&nbsp;
It was a sad day when the intelligence of this young creature&rsquo;s
death arrived.&nbsp; Charlotte wrote thus on January 12th, 1840:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your letter, which I received this morning, was
one of painful interest.&nbsp; Anne C., it seems, is <i>dead</i>; when
I saw her last, she was a young, beautiful, and happy girl; and now
&lsquo;life&rsquo;s fitful fever&rsquo; is over with her, and she &lsquo;sleeps
well.&rsquo;&nbsp; I shall never see her again.&nbsp; It is a sorrowful
thought; for she was a warm-hearted, affectionate being, and I cared
for her.&nbsp; Wherever I seek for her now in this world, she cannot
be found, no more than a flower or a leaf which withered twenty years
ago.&nbsp; A bereavement of this kind gives one a glimpse of the feeling
those must have who have seen all drop round them, friend after friend,
and are left to end their pilgrimage alone.&nbsp; But tears are fruitless,
and I try not to repine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this winter, Charlotte employed her leisure hours in writing
a story.&nbsp; Some fragments of the manuscript yet remain, but it is
in too small a hand to be read without great fatigue to the eyes; and
one cares the less to read it, as she herself condemned it, in the preface
to the &ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; by saying that in this story she had
got over such taste as she might once have had for the &ldquo;ornamental
and redundant in composition.&rdquo;&nbsp; The beginning, too, as she
acknowledges, was on a scale commensurate with one of Richardson&rsquo;s
novels, of seven or eight volumes.&nbsp; I gather some of these particulars
from a copy of a letter, apparently in reply to one from Wordsworth,
to whom she had sent the commencement of the story, sometime in the
summer of 1840.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Authors are generally very tenacious of their
productions, but I am not so much attached to this but that I can give
it up without much distress.&nbsp; No doubt, if I had gone on, I should
have made quite a Richardsonian concern of it . . . I had materials
in my head for half-a-dozen volumes . . . Of course, it is with considerable
regret I relinquish any scheme so charming as the one I have sketched.&nbsp;
It is very edifying and profitable to create a world out of your own
brains, and people it with inhabitants, who are so many Melchisedecs,
and have no father nor mother but your own imagination . . . I am sorry
I did not exist fifty or sixty years ago, when the &lsquo;Ladies&rsquo;
Magazine&rsquo; was flourishing like a green bay-tree.&nbsp; In that
case, I make no doubt, my aspirations after literary fame would have
met with due encouragement, and I should have had the pleasure of introducing
Messrs. Percy and West into the very best society, and recording all
their sayings and doings in double-columned close-printed pages . .
. I recollect, when I was a child, getting hold of some antiquated volumes,
and reading them by stealth with the most exquisite pleasure.&nbsp;
You give a correct description of the patient Grisels of those days.&nbsp;
My aunt was one of them; and to this day she thinks the tales of the
&lsquo;Ladies&rsquo; Magazine&rsquo; infinitely superior to any trash
of modern literature.&nbsp; So do I; for I read them in childhood, and
childhood has a very strong faculty of admiration, but a very weak one
of criticism . . . I am pleased that you cannot quite decide whether
I am an attorney&rsquo;s clerk or a novel-reading dress-maker.&nbsp;
I will not help you at all in the discovery; and as to my handwriting,
or the ladylike touches in my style and imagery, you must not draw any
conclusion from that&mdash;I may employ an amanuensis.&nbsp; Seriously,
sir, I am very much obliged to you for your kind and candid letter.&nbsp;
I almost wonder you took the trouble to read and notice the novelette
of an anonymous scribe, who had not even the manners to tell you whether
he was a man or a woman, or whether his &lsquo;C. T.&rsquo; meant Charles
Timms or Charlotte Tomkins.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two or three things noticeable in the letter from which
these extracts are taken.&nbsp; The first is the initials with which
she had evidently signed the former one to which she alludes.&nbsp;
About this time, to her more familiar correspondents, she occasionally
calls herself &ldquo;Charles Thunder,&rdquo; making a kind of pseudonym
for herself out of her Christian name, and the meaning of her Greek
surname.&nbsp; In the next place, there is a touch of assumed smartness,
very different from the simple, womanly, dignified letter which she
had written to Southey, under nearly similar circumstances, three years
before.&nbsp; I imagine the cause of this difference to be twofold.&nbsp;
Southey, in his reply to her first letter, had appealed to the higher
parts of her nature, in calling her to consider whether literature was,
or was not, the best course for a woman to pursue.&nbsp; But the person
to whom she addressed this one had evidently confined himself to purely
literary criticisms, besides which, her sense of humour was tickled
by the perplexity which her correspondent felt as to whether he was
addressing a man or a woman.&nbsp; She rather wished to encourage the
former idea; and, in consequence, possibly, assumed something of the
flippancy which very probably existed in her brother&rsquo;s style of
conversation, from whom she would derive her notions of young manhood,
not likely, as far as refinement was concerned, to be improved by the
other specimens she had seen, such as the curates whom she afterwards
represented in &ldquo;Shirley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These curates were full of strong, High-Church feeling.&nbsp; Belligerent
by nature, it was well for their professional character that they had,
as clergymen, sufficient scope for the exercise of their warlike propensities.&nbsp;
Mr. Bront&euml;, with all his warm regard for Church and State, had
a great respect for mental freedom; and, though he was the last man
in the world to conceal his opinions, he lived in perfect amity with
all the respectable part of those who differed from him.&nbsp; Not so
the curates.&nbsp; Dissent was schism, and schism was condemned in the
Bible.&nbsp; In default of turbaned Saracens, they entered on a crusade
against Methodists in broadcloth; and the consequence was that the Methodists
and Baptists refused to pay the church-rates.&nbsp; Miss Bront&euml;
thus describes the state of things at this time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Little Haworth has been all in a bustle about
church-rates, since you were here.&nbsp; We had a stirring meeting in
the schoolroom.&nbsp; Papa took the chair, and Mr. C. and Mr. W. acted
as his supporters, one on each side.&nbsp; There was violent opposition,
which set Mr. C.&rsquo;s Irish blood in a ferment, and if papa had not
kept him quiet, partly by persuasion and partly by compulsion, he would
have given the Dissenters their kale through the reek&mdash;a Scotch
proverb, which I will explain to you another time.&nbsp; He and Mr.
W. both bottled up their wrath for that time, but it was only to explode
with redoubled force at a future period.&nbsp; We had two sermons on
dissent, and its consequences, preached last Sunday&mdash;one in the
afternoon by Mr. W., and one in the evening by Mr. C.&nbsp; All the
Dissenters were invited to come and hear, and they actually shut up
their chapels, and came in a body; of course the church was crowded.&nbsp;
Mr. W. delivered a noble, eloquent, High-Church, Apostolical-Succession
discourse, in which he banged the Dissenters most fearlessly and unflinchingly.&nbsp;
I thought they had got enough for one while, but it was nothing to the
dose that was thrust down their throats in the evening.&nbsp; A keener,
cleverer, bolder, and more heart-stirring harangue than that which Mr.
C. delivered from Haworth pulpit, last Sunday evening, I never heard.&nbsp;
He did not rant; he did not cant; he did not whine; he did not sniggle;
he just got up and spoke with the boldness of a man who was impressed
with the truth of what he was saying, who has no fear of his enemies,
and no dread of consequences.&nbsp; His sermon lasted an hour, yet I
was sorry when it was done.&nbsp; I do not say that I agree either with
him, or with Mr. W., either in all or in half their opinions.&nbsp;
I consider them bigoted, intolerant, and wholly unjustifiable on the
ground of common sense.&nbsp; My conscience will not let me be either
a Puseyite or a Hookist; <i>mais</i>, if I were a Dissenter, I would
have taken the first opportunity of kicking, or of horse-whipping both
the gentlemen for their stern, bitter attack on my religion and its
teachers.&nbsp; But in spite of all this, I admired the noble integrity
which could dictate so fearless an opposition against so strong an antagonist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Mr. W. has given another lecture at the Keighley
Mechanics&rsquo; Institution, and papa has also given a lecture; both
are spoken of very highly in the newspapers, and it is mentioned as
a matter of wonder that such displays of intellect should emanate from
the village of Haworth, &lsquo;situated among the bogs and mountains,
and, until very lately, supposed to be in a state of semi-barbarism.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Such are the words of the newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To fill up the account of this outwardly eventless year, I may add
a few more extracts from the letters entrusted to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May 15th, 1840.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be over-persuaded to marry a man you can never respect&mdash;I
do not say <i>love</i>; because, I think, if you can respect a person
before marriage, moderate love at least will come after; and as to intense
<i>passion</i>, I am convinced that that is no desirable feeling.&nbsp;
In the first place, it seldom or never meets with a requital; and, in
the second place, if it did, the feeling would be only temporary: it
would last the honeymoon, and then, perhaps, give place to disgust,
or indifference, worse, perhaps, than disgust.&nbsp; Certainly this
would be the case on the man&rsquo;s part; and on the woman&rsquo;s&mdash;God
help her, if she is left to love passionately and alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tolerably well convinced that I shall never marry at
all.&nbsp; Reason tells me so, and I am not so utterly the slave of
feeling but that I can <i>occasionally hear</i> her voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June 2nd, 1840.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. is not yet come to Haworth; but she is to come on the condition
that I first go and stay a few days there.&nbsp; If all be well, I shall
go next Wednesday.&nbsp; I may stay at G--- until Friday or Saturday,
and the early part of the following week I shall pass with you, if you
will have me&mdash;which last sentence indeed is nonsense, for as I
shall be glad to see you, so I know you will be glad to see me.&nbsp;
This arrangement will not allow much time, but it is the only practicable
one which, considering all the circumstances, I can effect.&nbsp; Do
not urge me to stay more than two or three days, because I shall be
obliged to refuse you.&nbsp; I intend to walk to Keighley, there to
take the coach as far as B---, then to get some one to carry my box,
and to walk the rest of the way to G-.&nbsp; If I manage this, I think
I shall contrive very well.&nbsp; I shall reach B. by about five o&rsquo;clock,
and then I shall have the cool of the evening for the walk.&nbsp; I
have communicated the whole arrangement to M.&nbsp; I desire exceedingly
to see both her and you.&nbsp; Good-bye.</p>
<p>C. B.<br />
C. B.<br />
C. B.<br />
C. B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have any better plan to suggest I am open to conviction,
provided your plan is practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;August 20th, 1840.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anything of Miss H. lately?&nbsp; I wish they,
or somebody else, would get me a situation.&nbsp; I have answered advertisements
without number, but my applications have met with no success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got another bale of French books from G. containing
upwards of forty volumes.&nbsp; I have read about half.&nbsp; They are
like the rest, clever, wicked, sophistical, and immoral.&nbsp; The best
of it is, they give one a thorough idea of France and Paris, and are
the best substitute for French conversation that I have met with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I positively have nothing more to say to you, for I am in
a stupid humour.&nbsp; You must excuse this letter not being quite as
long as your own.&nbsp; I have written to you soon, that you might not
look after the postman in vain.&nbsp; Preserve this writing as a curiosity
in caligraphy&mdash;I think it is exquisite&mdash;all brilliant black
blots, and utterly illegible letters.&nbsp; &lsquo;CALIBAN.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The wind bloweth where it listeth.&nbsp; Thou hearest
the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither
it goeth.&rsquo;&nbsp; That, I believe, is Scripture, though in what
chapter or book, or whether it be correctly quoted, I can&rsquo;t possibly
say.&nbsp; However, it behoves me to write a letter to a young woman
of the name of E., with whom I was once acquainted, &lsquo;in life&rsquo;s
morning march, when my spirit was young.&rsquo;&nbsp; This young woman
wished me to write to her some time since, though I have nothing to
say&mdash;I e&rsquo;en put it off, day by day, till at last, fearing
that she will &lsquo;curse me by her gods,&rsquo; I feel constrained
to sit down and tack a few lines together, which she may call a letter
or not as she pleases.&nbsp; Now if the young woman expects sense in
this production, she will find herself miserably disappointed.&nbsp;
I shall dress her a dish of salmagundi&mdash;I shall cook a hash&mdash;compound
a stew&mdash;toss up an <i>omelette souffl&egrave;e &agrave; la Fran&ccedil;aise</i>,
and send it her with my respects.&nbsp; The wind, which is very high
up in our hills of Judea, though, I suppose, down in the Philistine
flats of B. parish it is nothing to speak of, has produced the same
effects on the contents of my knowledge-box that a quaigh of usquebaugh
does upon those of most other bipeds.&nbsp; I see everything <i>couleur
de rose</i>, and am strongly inclined to dance a jig, if I knew how.&nbsp;
I think I must partake of the nature of a pig or an ass&mdash;both which
animals are strongly affected by a high wind.&nbsp; From what quarter
the wind blows I cannot tell, for I never could in my life; but I should
very much like to know how the great brewing-tub of Bridlington Bay
works, and what sort of yeasty froth rises just now on the waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman of the name of Mrs. B., it seems, wants a teacher.&nbsp;
I wish she would have me; and I have written to Miss W. to tell her
so.&nbsp; Verily, it is a delightful thing to live here at home, at
full liberty to do just what one pleases.&nbsp; But I recollect some
scrubby old fable about grasshoppers and ants, by a scrubby old knave
yclept &AElig;sop; the grasshoppers sang all the summer, and starved
all the winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A distant relation of mine, one Patrick Branwell, has set
off to seek his fortune in the wild, wandering, adventurous, romantic,
knight-errant-like capacity of clerk on the Leeds and Manchester Railroad.&nbsp;
Leeds and Manchester&mdash;where are they?&nbsp; Cities in the wilderness,
like Tadmor, alias Palmyra&mdash;are they not?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one little trait respecting Mr. W. which lately came
to my knowledge, which gives a glimpse of the better side of his character.&nbsp;
Last Saturday night he had been sitting an hour in the parlour with
Papa; and, as he went away, I heard Papa say to him &lsquo;What is the
matter with you?&nbsp; You seem in very low spirits to-night.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been to see a poor young
girl, who, I&rsquo;m afraid, is dying.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed; what
is her name?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Susan Bland, the daughter of John Bland,
the superintendent.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now Susan Bland is my oldest and best
scholar in the Sunday-school; and, when I heard that, I thought I would
go as soon as I could to see her.&nbsp; I did go on Monday afternoon,
and found her on her way to that &lsquo;bourn whence no traveller returns.&rsquo;&nbsp;
After sitting with her some time, I happened to ask her mother, if she
thought a little port wine would do her good.&nbsp; She replied that
the doctor had recommended it, and that when Mr. W. was last there,
he had brought them a bottle of wine and jar of preserves.&nbsp; She
added, that he was always good-natured to poor folks, and seemed to
have a deal of feeling and kindheartedness about him.&nbsp; No doubt,
there are defects in his character, but there are also good qualities
. . . God bless him!&nbsp; I wonder who, with his advantages, would
be without his faults.&nbsp; I know many of his faulty actions, many
of his weak points; yet, where I am, he shall always find rather a defender
than an accuser.&nbsp; To be sure, my opinion will go but a very little
way to decide his character; what of that?&nbsp; People should do right
as far as their ability extends.&nbsp; You are not to suppose, from
all this, that Mr. W. and I are on very amiable terms; we are not at
all.&nbsp; We are distant, cold, and reserved.&nbsp; We seldom speak;
and when we do, it is only to exchange the most trivial and common-place
remarks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mrs. B. alluded to in this letter, as in want of a governess,
entered into a correspondence with Miss Bront&euml;, and expressed herself
much pleased with the letters she received from her, with the &ldquo;style
and candour of the application,&rdquo; in which Charlotte had taken
care to tell her, that if she wanted a showy, elegant, or fashionable
person, her correspondent was not fitted for such a situation.&nbsp;
But Mrs. B. required her governess to give instructions in music and
singing, for which Charlotte was not qualified: and, accordingly, the
negotiation fell through.&nbsp; But Miss Bront&euml; was not one to
sit down in despair after disappointment.&nbsp; Much as she disliked
the life of a private governess, it was her duty to relieve her father
of the burden of her support, and this was the only way open to her.&nbsp;
So she set to advertising and inquiring with fresh vigour.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a little occurrence took place, described in one
of her letters, which I shall give, as it shows her instinctive aversion
to a particular class of men, whose vices some have supposed she looked
upon with indulgence.&nbsp; The extract tells all that need be known,
for the purpose I have in view, of the miserable pair to whom it relates.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You remember Mr. and Mrs. ---?&nbsp; Mrs. ---
came here the other day, with a most melancholy tale of her wretched
husband&rsquo;s drunken, extravagant, profligate habits.&nbsp; She asked
Papa&rsquo;s advice; there was nothing she said but ruin before them.&nbsp;
They owed debts which they could never pay.&nbsp; She expected Mr. ---&rsquo;s
instant dismissal from his curacy; she knew, from bitter experience,
that his vices were utterly hopeless.&nbsp; He treated her and her child
savagely; with much more to the same effect.&nbsp; Papa advised her
to leave him for ever, and go home, if she had a home to go to.&nbsp;
She said, this was what she had long resolved to do; and she would leave
him directly, as soon as Mr. B. dismissed him.&nbsp; She expressed great
disgust and contempt towards him, and did not affect to have the shadow
of regard in any way.&nbsp; I do not wonder at this, but I do wonder
she should ever marry a man towards whom her feelings must always have
been pretty much the same as they are now.&nbsp; I am morally certain
no decent woman could experience anything but aversion towards such
a man as Mr. ---.&nbsp; Before I knew, or suspected his character, and
when I rather wondered at his versatile talents, I felt it in an uncontrollable
degree.&nbsp; I hated to talk with him&mdash;hated to look at him; though
as I was not certain that there was substantial reason for such a dislike,
and thought it absurd to trust to mere instinct, I both concealed and
repressed the feeling as much as I could; and, on all occasions, treated
him with as much civility as I was mistress of.&nbsp; I was struck with
Mary&rsquo;s expression of a similar feeling at first sight; she said,
when we left him, &lsquo;That is a hideous man, Charlotte!&rsquo;&nbsp;
I thought &lsquo;He is indeed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>Early in March, 1841, Miss Bront&euml; obtained her second and last
situation as a governess.&nbsp; This time she esteemed herself fortunate
in becoming a member of a kind-hearted and friendly household.&nbsp;
The master of it, she especially regarded as a valuable friend, whose
advice helped to guide her in one very important step of her life.&nbsp;
But as her definite acquirements were few, she had to eke them out by
employing her leisure time in needlework; and altogether her position
was that of &ldquo;bonne&rdquo; or nursery governess, liable to repeated
and never-ending calls upon her time.&nbsp; This description of uncertain,
yet perpetual employment, subject to the exercise of another person&rsquo;s
will at all hours of the day, was peculiarly trying to one whose life
at home had been full of abundant leisure.&nbsp; <i>Idle</i> she never
was in any place, but of the multitude of small talks, plans, duties,
pleasures, &amp;c., that make up most people&rsquo;s days, her home
life was nearly destitute.&nbsp; This made it possible for her to go
through long and deep histories of feeling and imagination, for which
others, odd as it sounds, have rarely time.&nbsp; This made it inevitable
that&mdash;later on, in her too short career&mdash;the intensity of
her feeling should wear out her physical health.&nbsp; The habit of
&ldquo;making out,&rdquo; which had grown with her growth, and strengthened
with her strength, had become a part of her nature.&nbsp; Yet all exercise
of her strongest and most characteristic faculties was now out of the
question.&nbsp; She could not (as while she was at Miss W---&rsquo;s)
feel, amidst the occupations of the day, that when evening came, she
might employ herself in more congenial ways.&nbsp; No doubt, all who
enter upon the career of a governess have to relinquish much; no doubt,
it must ever be a life of sacrifice; but to Charlotte Bront&euml; it
was a perpetual attempt to force all her faculties into a direction
for which the whole of her previous life had unfitted them.&nbsp; Moreover,
the little Bront&euml;s had been brought up motherless; and from knowing
nothing of the gaiety and the sportiveness of childhood&mdash;from never
having experienced caresses or fond attentions themselves&mdash;they
were ignorant of the very nature of infancy, or how to call out its
engaging qualities.&nbsp; Children were to them the troublesome necessities
of humanity; they had never been drawn into contact with them in any
other way.&nbsp; Years afterwards, when Miss Bront&euml; came to stay
with us, she watched our little girls perpetually; and I could not persuade
her that they were only average specimens of well brought up children.&nbsp;
She was surprised and touched by any sign of thoughtfulness for others,
of kindness to animals, or of unselfishness on their part: and constantly
maintained that she was in the right, and I in the wrong, when we differed
on the point of their unusual excellence.&nbsp; All this must be borne
in mind while reading the following letters.&nbsp; And it must likewise
be borne in mind&mdash;by those who, surviving her, look back upon her
life from their mount of observation&mdash;how no distaste, no suffering
ever made her shrink from any course which she believed it to be her
duty to engage in.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March 3rd, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told some time since, that I meant to get a situation, and
when I said so my resolution was quite fixed.&nbsp; I felt that however
often I was disappointed, I had no intention of relinquishing my efforts.&nbsp;
After being severely baffled two or three times,&mdash;after a world
of trouble, in the way of correspondence and interviews,&mdash;I have
at length succeeded, and am fairly established in my new place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The house is not very large, but exceedingly comfortable
and well regulated; the grounds are fine and extensive.&nbsp; In taking
the place, I have made a large sacrifice in the way of salary, in the
hope of securing comfort,&mdash;by which word I do not mean to express
good eating and drinking, or warm fire, or a soft bed, but the society
of cheerful faces, and minds and hearts not dug out of a lead-mine,
or cut from a marble quarry.&nbsp; My salary is not really more than
16<i>l</i>. per annum, though it is nominally 20<i>l</i>., but the expense
of washing will be deducted therefrom.&nbsp; My pupils are two in number,
a girl of eight, and a boy of six.&nbsp; As to my employers, you will
not expect me to say much about their characters when I tell you that
I only arrived here yesterday.&nbsp; I have not the faculty of telling
an individual&rsquo;s disposition at first sight.&nbsp; Before I can
venture to pronounce on a character, I must see it first under various
lights and from various points of view.&nbsp; All I can say therefore
is, both Mr. and Mrs. --- seem to me good sort of people.&nbsp; I have
as yet had no cause to complain of want of considerateness or civility.&nbsp;
My pupils are wild and unbroken, but apparently well-disposed.&nbsp;
I wish I may be able to say as much next time I write to you.&nbsp;
My earnest wish and endeavour will be to please them.&nbsp; If I can
but feel that I am giving satisfaction, and if at the same time I can
keep my health, I shall, I hope, be moderately happy.&nbsp; But no one
but myself can tell how hard a governess&rsquo;s work is to me&mdash;for
no one but myself is aware how utterly averse my whole mind and nature
are for the employment.&nbsp; Do not think that I fail to blame myself
for this, or that I leave any means unemployed to conquer this feeling.&nbsp;
Some of my greatest difficulties lie in things that would appear to
you comparatively trivial.&nbsp; I find it so hard to repel the rude
familiarity of children.&nbsp; I find it so difficult to ask either
servants or mistress for anything I want, however much I want it.&nbsp;
It is less pain for me to endure the greatest inconvenience than to
go into the kitchen to request its removal.&nbsp; I am a fool.&nbsp;
Heaven knows I cannot help it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now can you tell me whether it is considered improper for
governesses to ask their friends to come and see them.&nbsp; I do not
mean, of course, to stay, but just for a call of an hour or two?&nbsp;
If it is not absolute treason, I do fervently request that you will
contrive, in some way or other, to let me have a sight of your face.&nbsp;
Yet I feel, at the same time, that I am making a very foolish and almost
impracticable demand; yet this is only four miles from B---!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March 21st.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse a very short answer to your most welcome letter;
for my time is entirely occupied.&nbsp; Mrs. --- expected a good deal
of sewing from me.&nbsp; I cannot sew much during the day, on account
of the children, who require the utmost attention.&nbsp; I am obliged,
therefore, to devote the evenings to this business.&nbsp; Write to me
often; very long letters.&nbsp; It will do both of us good.&nbsp; This
place is far better than ---, but God knows, I have enough to do to
keep a good heart in the matter.&nbsp; What you said has cheered me
a little.&nbsp; I wish I could always act according to your advice.&nbsp;
Home-sickness affects me sorely.&nbsp; I like Mr. --- extremely.&nbsp;
The children are over-indulged, and consequently hard at times to manage.&nbsp;
<i>Do, do</i>, do come and see me; if it be a breach of etiquette, never
mind.&nbsp; If you can only stop an hour, come.&nbsp; Talk no more about
my forsaking you; my darling, I could not afford to do it.&nbsp; I find
it is not in my nature to get on in this weary world without sympathy
and attachment in some quarter; and seldom indeed do we find it.&nbsp;
It is too great a treasure to be ever wantonly thrown away when once
secured.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Bront&euml; had not been many weeks in her new situation before
she had a proof of the kind-hearted hospitality of her employers.&nbsp;
Mr. --- wrote to her father, and urgently invited him to come and make
acquaintance with his daughter&rsquo;s new home, by spending a week
with her in it; and Mrs. --- expressed great regret when one of Miss
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s friends drove up to the house to leave a letter
or parcel, without entering.&nbsp; So she found that all her friends
might freely visit her, and that her father would be received with especial
gladness.&nbsp; She thankfully acknowledged this kindness in writing
to urge her friend afresh to come and see her; which she accordingly
did.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hardly fancy it possible, I dare say, that I cannot
find a quarter of an hour to scribble a note in; but so it is; and when
a note is written, it has to be carried a mile to the post, and that
consumes nearly an hour, which is a large portion of the day.&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. --- have been gone a week.&nbsp; I heard from them this
morning.&nbsp; No time is fixed for their return, but I hope it will
not be delayed long, or I shall miss the chance of seeing Anne this
vacation.&nbsp; She came home, I understand, last Wednesday, and is
only to be allowed three weeks&rsquo; vacation, because the family she
is with are going to Scarborough.&nbsp; <i>I should like to see her</i>,
to judge for myself of the state of her health.&nbsp; I dare not trust
any other person&rsquo;s report, no one seems minute enough in their
observations.&nbsp; I should very much have liked you to have seen her.&nbsp;
I have got on very well with the servants and children so far; yet it
is dreary, solitary work.&nbsp; You can tell as well as me the lonely
feeling of being without a companion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after this was written, Mr. and Mrs. --- returned, in time to
allow Charlotte to go and look after Anne&rsquo;s health, which, as
she found to her intense anxiety, was far from strong.&nbsp; What could
she do to nurse and cherish up this little sister, the youngest of them
all?&nbsp; Apprehension about her brought up once more the idea of keeping
a school.&nbsp; If, by this means, they three could live together, and
maintain themselves, all might go well.&nbsp; They would have some time
of their own, in which to try again and yet again at that literary career,
which, in spite of all baffling difficulties, was never quite set aside
as an ultimate object; but far the strongest motive with Charlotte was
the conviction that Anne&rsquo;s health was so delicate that it required
a degree of tending which none but her sister could give.&nbsp; Thus
she wrote during those midsummer holidays.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Haworth, July 18th, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited long and anxiously for you, on the Thursday that
you promised to come.&nbsp; I quite wearied my eyes with watching from
the window, eye-glass in hand, and sometimes spectacles on nose.&nbsp;
However, you are not to blame . . . and as to disappointment, why, all
must suffer disappointment at some period or other of their lives.&nbsp;
But a hundred things I had to say to you will now be forgotten, and
never said.&nbsp; There is a project hatching in this house, which both
Emily and I anxiously wished to discuss with you.&nbsp; The project
is yet in its infancy, hardly peeping from its shell; and whether it
will ever come out a fine full-fledged chicken, or will turn addle and
die before it cheeps, is one of those considerations that are but dimly
revealed by the oracles of futurity.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t be nonplussed
by all this metaphorical mystery.&nbsp; I talk of a plain and everyday
occurrence, though, in Delphic style, I wrap up the information in figures
of speech concerning eggs, chickens etceatera, etcaeterorum.&nbsp; To
come to the point: Papa and aunt talk, by fits and starts, of our&mdash;id
est, Emily, Anne, and myself&mdash;commencing a school!&nbsp; I have
often, you know, said how much I wished such a thing; but I never could
conceive where the capital was to come from for making such a speculation.&nbsp;
I was well aware, indeed, that aunt had money, but I always considered
that she was the last person who would offer a loan for the purpose
in question.&nbsp; A loan, however, she <i>has</i> offered, or rather
intimates that she perhaps <i>will</i> offer in case pupils can be secured,
an eligible situation obtained, &amp;c.&nbsp; This sounds very fair,
but still there are matters to be considered which throw something of
a damp upon the scheme.&nbsp; I do not expect that aunt will sink more
than 150<i>l</i>. in such a venture; and would it be possible to establish
a respectable (not by any means a <i>showy</i>) school, and to commence
housekeeping with a capital of only that amount?&nbsp; Propound the
question to your sister, if you think she can answer it; if not, don&rsquo;t
say a word on the subject.&nbsp; As to getting into debt, that is a
thing we could none of us reconcile our mind to for a moment.&nbsp;
We do not care how modest, how humble our commencement be, so it be
made on sure grounds, and have a safe foundation.&nbsp; In thinking
of all possible and impossible places where we could establish a school,
I have thought of Burlington, or rather of the neighbourhood of Burlington.&nbsp;
Do you remember whether there was any other school there besides that
of Miss ---?&nbsp; This is, of course, a perfectly crude and random
idea.&nbsp; There are a hundred reasons why it should be an impracticable
one.&nbsp; We have no connections, no acquaintances there; it is far
from home, &amp;c.&nbsp; Still, I fancy the ground in the East Riding
is less fully occupied than in the West.&nbsp; Much inquiry and consideration
will be necessary, of course, before any place is decided on; and I
fear much time will elapse before any plan is executed . . . Write as
soon as you can.&nbsp; I shall not leave my present situation till my
future prospects assume a more fixed and definite aspect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fortnight afterwards, we see that the seed has been sown which
was to grow up into a plan materially influencing her future life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;August 7th, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Saturday evening; I have put the children to bed;
now I am going to sit down and answer your letter.&nbsp; I am again
by myself&mdash;housekeeper and governess&mdash;for Mr. and Mrs. ---
are staying at ---.&nbsp; To speak truth, though I am solitary while
they are away, it is still by far the happiest part of my time.&nbsp;
The children are under decent control, the servants are very observant
and attentive to me, and the occasional absence of the master and mistress
relieves me from the duty of always endeavouring to seem cheerful and
conversable.&nbsp; Martha ---, it appears, is in the way of enjoying
great advantages; so is Mary, for you will be surprised to hear that
she is returning immediately to the Continent with her brother; not,
however, to stay there, but to take a month&rsquo;s tour and recreation.&nbsp;
I have had a long letter from Mary, and a packet containing a present
of a very handsome black silk scarf, and a pair of beautiful kid gloves,
bought at Brussels.&nbsp; Of course, I was in one sense pleased with
the gift&mdash;pleased that they should think of me so far off, amidst
the excitements of one of the most splendid capitals of Europe; and
yet it felt irksome to accept it.&nbsp; I should think Mary and Martha
have not more than sufficient pocket-money to supply themselves.&nbsp;
I wish they had testified their regard by a less expensive token.&nbsp;
Mary&rsquo;s letters spoke of some of the pictures and cathedrals she
had seen&mdash;pictures the most exquisite, cathedrals the most venerable.&nbsp;
I hardly know what swelled to my throat as I read her letter: such a
vehement impatience of restraint and steady work; such a strong wish
for wings&mdash;wings such as wealth can furnish; such an urgent thirst
to see, to know, to learn; something internal seemed to expand bodily
for a minute.&nbsp; I was tantalised by the consciousness of faculties
unexercised,&mdash;then all collapsed, and I despaired.&nbsp; My dear,
I would hardly make that confession to any one but yourself; and to
you, rather in a letter than <i>viv&acirc; voce</i>.&nbsp; These rebellious
and absurd emotions were only momentary; I quelled them in five minutes.&nbsp;
I hope they will not revive, for they were acutely painful.&nbsp; No
further steps have been taken about the project I mentioned to you,
nor probably will be for the present; but Emily, and Anne, and I, keep
it in view.&nbsp; It is our polar star, and we look to it in all circumstances
of despondency.&nbsp; I begin to suspect I am writing in a strain which
will make you think I am unhappy.&nbsp; This is far from being the case;
on the contrary, I know my place is a favourable one, for a governess.&nbsp;
What dismays and haunts me sometimes, is a conviction that I have no
natural knack for my vocation.&nbsp; If teaching only were requisite,
it would be smooth and easy; but it is the living in other people&rsquo;s
houses&mdash;the estrangement from one&rsquo;s real character&mdash;the
adoption of a cold, rigid, apathetic exterior, that is painful . . .
You will not mention our school project at present.&nbsp; A project
not actually commenced is always uncertain.&nbsp; Write to me often,
my dear Nell; you <i>know</i> your letters are valued.&nbsp; Your &lsquo;loving
child&rsquo; (as you choose to call me so),</p>
<p>C. B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; I am well in health; don&rsquo;t fancy I am not,
but I have one aching feeling at my heart (I must allude to it, though
I had resolved not to).&nbsp; It is about Anne; she has so much to endure:
far, far more than I ever had.&nbsp; When my thoughts turn to her, they
always see her as a patient, persecuted stranger.&nbsp; I know what
concealed susceptibility is in her nature, when her feelings are wounded.&nbsp;
I wish I could be with her, to administer a little balm.&nbsp; She is
more lonely&mdash;less gifted with the power of making friends, even
than I am.&nbsp; &lsquo;Drop the subject.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She could bear much for herself; but she could not patiently bear
the sorrows of others, especially of her sisters; and again, of the
two sisters, the idea of the little, gentle, youngest suffering in lonely
patience, was insupportable to her.&nbsp; Something must be done.&nbsp;
No matter if the desired end were far away; all time was lost in which
she was not making progress, however slow, towards it.&nbsp; To have
a school, was to have some portion of daily leisure, uncontrolled but
by her own sense of duty; it was for the three sisters, loving each
other with so passionate an affection, to be together under one roof,
and yet earning their own subsistence; above all, it was to have the
power of watching over these two whose life and happiness were ever
to Charlotte far more than her own.&nbsp; But no trembling impatience
should lead her to take an unwise step in haste.&nbsp; She inquired
in every direction she could, as to the chances which a new school might
have of success.&nbsp; In all there seemed more establishments like
the one which the sisters wished to set up than could be supported.&nbsp;
What was to be done?&nbsp; Superior advantages must be offered.&nbsp;
But how?&nbsp; They themselves abounded in thought, power, and information;
but these are qualifications scarcely fit to be inserted in a prospectus.&nbsp;
Of French they knew something; enough to read it fluently, but hardly
enough to teach it in competition with natives or professional masters.&nbsp;
Emily and Anne had some knowledge of music; but here again it was doubtful
whether, without more instruction, they could engage to give lessons
in it.</p>
<p>Just about this time, Miss W--- was thinking of relinquishing her
school at Dewsbury Moor; and offered to give it up in favour of her
old pupils, the Bront&euml;s.&nbsp; A sister of hers had taken the active
management since the time when Charlotte was a teacher; but the number
of pupils had diminished; and, if the Bront&euml;s undertook it, they
would have to try and work it up to its former state of prosperity.&nbsp;
This, again, would require advantages on their part which they did not
at present possess, but which Charlotte caught a glimpse of.&nbsp; She
resolved to follow the clue, and never to rest till she had reached
a successful issue.&nbsp; With the forced calm of a suppressed eagerness,
that sends a glow of desire through every word of the following letter,
she wrote to her aunt thus.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Aunt,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sept. 29th, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing of Miss W--- yet since I wrote to her,
intimating that I would accept her offer.&nbsp; I cannot conjecture
the reason of this long silence, unless some unforeseen impediment has
occurred in concluding the bargain.&nbsp; Meantime, a plan has been
suggested and approved by Mr. and Mrs. --- &rdquo; (the father and mother
of her pupils) &ldquo;and others, which I wish now to impart to you.&nbsp;
My friends recommend me, if I desire to secure permanent success, to
delay commencing the school for six months longer, and by all means
to contrive, by hook or by crook, to spend the intervening time in some
school on the continent.&nbsp; They say schools in England are so numerous,
competition so great, that without some such step towards attaining
superiority, we shall probably have a very hard struggle, and may fail
in the end.&nbsp; They say, moreover, that the loan of 100<i>l</i>.,
which you have been so kind as to offer us, will, perhaps, not be all
required now, as Miss W--- will lend us the furniture; and that, if
the speculation is intended to be a good and successful one, half the
sum, at least, ought to be laid out in the manner I have mentioned,
thereby insuring a more speedy repayment both of interest and principal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not go to France or to Paris.&nbsp; I would go to
Brussels, in Belgium.&nbsp; The cost of the journey there, at the dearest
rate of travelling, would be 5<i>l</i>.; living is there little more
than half as dear as it is in England, and the facilities for education
are equal or superior to any other place in Europe.&nbsp; In half a
year, I could acquire a thorough familiarity with French.&nbsp; I could
improve greatly in Italian, and even get a dash of German, i.e., providing
my health continued as good as it is now.&nbsp; Mary is now staying
at Brussels, at a first-rate establishment there.&nbsp; I should not
think of going to the Ch&acirc;teau de Kokleberg, where she is resident,
as the terms are much too high; but if I wrote to her, she, with the
assistance of Mrs. Jenkins, the wife of the British Chaplain, would
be able to secure me a cheap, decent residence and respectable protection.&nbsp;
I should have the opportunity of seeing her frequently; she would make
me acquainted with the city; and, with the assistance of her cousins,
I should probably be introduced to connections far more improving, polished,
and cultivated, than any I have yet known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are advantages which would turn to real account, when
we actually commenced a school; and, if Emily could share them with
me, we could take a footing in the world afterwards which we can never
do now.&nbsp; I say Emily instead of Anne; for Anne might take her turn
at some future period, if our school answered.&nbsp; I feel certain,
while I am writing, that you will see the propriety of what I say.&nbsp;
You always like to use your money to the best advantage.&nbsp; You are
not fond of making shabby purchases; when you do confer a favour, it
is often done in style; and depend upon it, 50<i>l</i>., or 100<i>l</i>.,
thus laid out, would be well employed.&nbsp; Of course, I know no other
friend in the world to whom I could apply on this subject except yourself.&nbsp;
I feel an absolute conviction that, if this advantage were allowed us,
it would be the making of us for life.&nbsp; Papa will, perhaps, think
it a wild and ambitious scheme; but who ever rose in the world without
ambition?&nbsp; When he left Ireland to go to Cambridge University,
he was as ambitious as I am now.&nbsp; I want us <i>all</i> to get on.&nbsp;
I know we have talents, and I want them to be turned to account.&nbsp;
I look to you, aunt, to help us.&nbsp; I think you will not refuse.&nbsp;
I know, if you consent, it shall not be my fault if you ever repent
your kindness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter was written from the house in which she was residing
as governess.&nbsp; It was some little time before an answer came.&nbsp;
Much had to be talked over between the father and aunt in Haworth Parsonage.&nbsp;
At last consent was given.&nbsp; Then, and not till then, she confided
her plan to an intimate friend.&nbsp; She was not one to talk over-much
about any project, while it remained uncertain&mdash;to speak about
her labour, in any direction, while its result was doubtful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nov. 2nd, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let us begin to quarrel.&nbsp; In the first place, I must
consider whether I will commence operations on the defensive, or the
offensive.&nbsp; The defensive, I think.&nbsp; You say, and I see plainly,
that your feelings have been hurt by an apparent want of confidence
on my part.&nbsp; You heard from others of Miss W---&rsquo;s overtures
before I communicated them to you myself.&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp;
I was deliberating on plans important to my future prospects.&nbsp;
I never exchanged a letter with you on the subject.&nbsp; True again.&nbsp;
This appears strange conduct to a friend, near and dear, long-known,
and never found wanting.&nbsp; Most true.&nbsp; I cannot give you my
<i>excuses</i> for this behaviour; this word <i>excuse</i> implies confession
of a fault, and I do not feel that I have been in fault.&nbsp; The plain
fact is, I <i>was</i> not, I am not now, certain of my destiny.&nbsp;
On the contrary, I have been most uncertain, perplexed with contradictory
schemes and proposals.&nbsp; My time, as I have often told you, is fully
occupied; yet I had many letters to write, which it was absolutely necessary
should be written.&nbsp; I knew it would avail nothing to write to you
then to say I was in doubt and uncertainty&mdash;hoping this, fearing
that, anxious, eagerly desirous to do what seemed impossible to be done.&nbsp;
When I thought of you in that busy interval, it was to resolve, that
you should know all when my way was clear, and my grand end attained.&nbsp;
If I could, I would always work in silence and obscurity, and let my
efforts be known by their results.&nbsp; Miss W--- did most kindly propose
that I should come to Dewsbury Moor and attempt to revive the school
her sister had relinquished.&nbsp; She offered me the use of her furniture.&nbsp;
At first, I received the proposal cordially, and prepared to do my utmost
to bring about success; but a fire was kindled in my very heart, which
I could not quench.&nbsp; I so longed to increase my attainments&mdash;to
become something better than I am; a glimpse of what I felt, I showed
to you in one of my former letters&mdash;only a glimpse; Mary cast oil
upon the flames&mdash;encouraged me, and in her own strong, energetic
language, heartened me on.&nbsp; I longed to go to Brussels; but how
could I get there?&nbsp; I wished for one, at least, of my sisters to
share the advantage with me.&nbsp; I fixed on Emily.&nbsp; She deserved
the reward, I knew.&nbsp; How could the point be managed?&nbsp; In extreme
excitement, I wrote a letter home, which carried the day.&nbsp; I made
an appeal to aunt for assistance, which was answered by consent.&nbsp;
Things are not settled; yet it is sufficient to say we have a <i>chance</i>
of going for half a year.&nbsp; Dewsbury Moor is relinquished.&nbsp;
Perhaps, fortunately so.&nbsp; In my secret soul, I believe there is
no cause to regret it.&nbsp; My plans for the future are bounded to
this intention: if I once get to Brussels, and if my health is spared,
I will do my best to make the utmost of every advantage that shall come
within my reach.&nbsp; When the half-year is expired, I will do what
I can.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Believe me, though I was born in April, the month
of cloud and sunshine, I am not changeful.&nbsp; My spirits are unequal,
and sometimes I speak vehemently, and sometimes I say nothing at all;
but I have a steady regard for you, and if you will let the cloud and
shower pass by, be sure the sun is always behind, obscured, but still
existing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Christmas she left her situation, after a parting with her employers
which seems to have affected and touched her greatly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
only made too much of me,&rdquo; was her remark, after leaving this
family; &ldquo;I did not deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>All four children hoped to meet together at their father&rsquo;s
house this December.&nbsp; Branwell expected to have a short leave of
absence from his employment as a clerk on the Leeds and Manchester Railway,
in which he had been engaged for five months.&nbsp; Anne arrived before
Christmas-day.&nbsp; She had rendered herself so valuable in her difficult
situation, that her employers vehemently urged her to return, although
she had announced her resolution to leave them; partly on account of
the harsh treatment she had received, and partly because her stay at
home, during her sisters&rsquo; absence in Belgium, seemed desirable,
when the age of the three remaining inhabitants of the parsonage was
taken into consideration.</p>
<p>After some correspondence and much talking over plans at home, it
seemed better, in consequence of letters which they received from Brussels
giving a discouraging account of the schools there, that Charlotte and
Emily should go to an institution at Lille, in the north of France,
which was highly recommended by Baptist Noel, and other clergymen.&nbsp;
Indeed, at the end of January, it was arranged that they were to set
off for this place in three weeks, under the escort of a French lady,
then visiting in London.&nbsp; The terms were 50<i>l</i>. each pupil,
for board and French alone, but a separate room was to be allowed for
this sum; without this indulgence, it was lower.&nbsp; Charlotte writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;January 20th, 1842.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it kind in aunt to consent to an extra sum for
a separate room.&nbsp; We shall find it a great privilege in many ways.&nbsp;
I regret the change from Brussels to Lille on many accounts, chiefly
that I shall not see Martha.&nbsp; Mary has been indefatigably kind
in providing me with information.&nbsp; She has grudged no labour, and
scarcely any expense, to that end.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s price is above
rubies.&nbsp; I have, in fact, two friends&mdash;you and her&mdash;staunch
and true, in whose faith and sincerity I have as strong a belief as
I have in the Bible.&nbsp; I have bothered you both&mdash;you especially;
but you always get the tongs and heap coals of fire upon my head.&nbsp;
I have had letters to write lately to Brussels, to Lille, and to London.&nbsp;
I have lots of chemises, nightgowns, pocket-handkerchiefs, and pockets
to make; besides clothes to repair.&nbsp; I have been, every week since
I came home, expecting to see Branwell, and he has never been able to
get over yet.&nbsp; We fully expect him, however, next Saturday.&nbsp;
Under these circumstances how can I go visiting?&nbsp; You tantalize
me to death with talking of conversations by the fireside.&nbsp; Depend
upon it, we are not to have any such for many a long month to come.&nbsp;
I get an interesting impression of old age upon my face; and when you
see me next I shall certainly wear caps and spectacles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>I am not aware of all the circumstances which led to the relinquishment
of the Lille plan.&nbsp; Brussels had had from the first a strong attraction
for Charlotte; and the idea of going there, in preference to any other
place, had only been given up in consequence of the information received
of the second-rate character of its schools.&nbsp; In one of her letters
reference has been made to Mrs. Jenkins, the wife of the chaplain of
the British Embassy.&nbsp; At the request of his brother&mdash;a clergyman,
living not many miles from Haworth, and an acquaintance of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s&mdash;she
made much inquiry, and at length, after some discouragement in her search,
heard of a school which seemed in every respect desirable.&nbsp; There
was an English lady who had long lived in the Orleans family, amidst
the various fluctuations of their fortunes, and who, when the Princess
Louise was married to King Leopold, accompanied her to Brussels, in
the capacity of reader.&nbsp; This lady&rsquo;s granddaughter was receiving
her education at the pensionnat of Madame H&eacute;ger; and so satisfied
was the grandmother with the kind of instruction given, that she named
the establishment, with high encomiums, to Mrs. Jerkins; and, in consequence,
it was decided that, if the terms suited, Miss Bront&euml; and Emily
should proceed thither.&nbsp; M. H&eacute;ger informs me that, on receipt
of a letter from Charlotte, making very particular inquiries as to the
possible amount of what are usually termed &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; he
and his wife were so much struck by the simple earnest tone of the letter,
that they said to each other:&mdash;&ldquo;These are the daughters of
an English pastor, of moderate means, anxious to learn with an ulterior
view of instructing others, and to whom the risk of additional expense
is of great consequence.&nbsp; Let us name a specific sum, within which
all expenses shall be included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was accordingly done; the agreement was concluded, and the Bront&euml;s
prepared to leave their native county for the first time, if we except
the melancholy and memorable residence at Cowan Bridge.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml;
determined to accompany his daughters.&nbsp; Mary and her brother, who
were experienced in foreign travelling, were also of the party.&nbsp;
Charlotte first saw London in the day or two they now stopped there;
and, from an expression in one of her subsequent letters, they all,
I believe, stayed at the Chapter Coffee House, Paternoster Row&mdash;a
strange, old-fashioned tavern, of which I shall have more to say hereafter.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s account of their journey is thus given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In passing through London, she seemed to think our business
was and ought to be, to see all the pictures and statues we could.&nbsp;
She knew the artists, and know where other productions of theirs were
to be found.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember what we saw except St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Emily was like her in these habits of mind, but certainly never took
her opinion, but always had one to offer . . . I don&rsquo;t know what
Charlotte thought of Brussels.&nbsp; We arrived in the dark, and went
next morning to our respective schools to see them.&nbsp; We were, of
course, much preoccupied, and our prospects gloomy.&nbsp; Charlotte
used to like the country round Brussels.&nbsp; &lsquo;At the top of
every hill you see something.&rsquo;&nbsp; She took, long solitary walks
on the occasional holidays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; took his daughters to the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle, Brussels;
remained one night at Mr. Jenkins&rsquo;; and straight returned to his
wild Yorkshire village.</p>
<p>What a contrast to that must the Belgian capital have presented to
those two young women thus left behind!&nbsp; Suffering acutely from
every strange and unaccustomed contact&mdash;far away from their beloved
home, and the dear moors beyond&mdash;their indomitable will was their
great support.&nbsp; Charlotte&rsquo;s own words, with regard to Emily,
are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After the age of twenty, having meantime studied
alone with diligence and perseverance, she went with me to an establishment
on the continent.&nbsp; The same suffering and conflict ensued, heightened
by the strong recoil of her upright heretic and English spirit from
the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and Romish system.&nbsp; Once more
she seemed sinking, but this time she rallied through the mere force
of resolution: with inward remorse and shame she looked back on her
former failure, and resolved to conquer, but the victory cost her dear.&nbsp;
She was never happy till she carried her hard-won knowledge back to
the remote English village, the old parsonage-house, and desolate Yorkshire
hills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They wanted learning.&nbsp; They came for learning.&nbsp; They would
learn.&nbsp; Where they had a distinct purpose to be achieved in intercourse
with their fellows, they forgot themselves; at all other times they
were miserably shy.&nbsp; Mrs. Jenkins told me that she used to ask
them to spend Sundays and holidays with her, until she found that they
felt more pain than pleasure from such visits.&nbsp; Emily hardly ever
uttered more than a monosyllable.&nbsp; Charlotte was sometimes excited
sufficiently to speak eloquently and well&mdash;on certain subjects;
but before her tongue was thus loosened, she had a habit of gradually
wheeling round on her chair, so as almost to conceal her face from the
person to whom she was speaking.</p>
<p>And yet there was much in Brussels to strike a responsive chord in
her powerful imagination.&nbsp; At length she was seeing somewhat of
that grand old world of which she had dreamed.&nbsp; As the gay crowds
passed by her, so had gay crowds paced those streets for centuries,
in all their varying costumes.&nbsp; Every spot told an historic tale,
extending back into the fabulous ages when Jan and Jannika, the aboriginal
giant and giantess, looked over the wall, forty feet high, of what is
now the Rue Villa Hermosa, and peered down upon the new settlers who
were to turn them out of the country in which they had lived since the
deluge.&nbsp; The great solemn Cathedral of St. Gudule, the religious
paintings, the striking forms and ceremonies of the Romish Church&mdash;all
made a deep impression on the girls, fresh from the bare walls and simple
worship of Haworth Church.&nbsp; And then they were indignant with themselves
for having been susceptible of this impression, and their stout Protestant
hearts arrayed themselves against the false Duessa that had thus imposed
upon them.</p>
<p>The very building they occupied as pupils, in Madame H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s
pensionnat, had its own ghostly train of splendid associations, marching
for ever, in shadowy procession, through and through the ancient rooms,
and shaded alleys of the gardens.&nbsp; From the splendour of to-day
in the Rue Royale, if you turn aside, near the statue of the General
Beliard, you look down four flights of broad stone steps upon the Rue
d&rsquo;Isabelle.&nbsp; The chimneys of the houses in it are below your
feet.&nbsp; Opposite to the lowest flight of steps, there is a large
old mansion facing you, with a spacious walled garden behind&mdash;and
to the right of it.&nbsp; In front of this garden, on the same side
as the mansion, and with great boughs of trees sweeping over their lowly
roofs, is a row of small, picturesque, old-fashioned cottages, not unlike,
in degree and uniformity, to the almshouses so often seen in an English
country town.&nbsp; The Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle looks as though it had
been untouched by the innovations of the builder for the last three
centuries; and yet any one might drop a stone into it from the back
windows of the grand modern hotels in the Rue Royale, built and furnished
in the newest Parisian fashion.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century, the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle was called the
Foss&eacute;-aux-Chiens; and the kennels for the ducal hounds occupied
the place where Madame H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s pensionnat now stands.&nbsp;
A hospital (in the ancient large meaning of the word) succeeded to the
kennel.&nbsp; The houseless and the poor, perhaps the leprous, were
received, by the brethren of a religious order, in a building on this
sheltered site; and what had been a fosse for defence, was filled up
with herb-gardens and orchards for upwards of a hundred years.&nbsp;
Then came the aristocratic guild of the cross-bow men&mdash;that company
the members whereof were required to prove their noble descent&mdash;untainted
for so many generations, before they could be admitted into the guild;
and, being admitted, were required to swear a solemn oath, that no other
pastime or exercise should take up any part of their leisure, the whole
of which was to be devoted to the practice of the noble art of shooting
with the cross-bow.&nbsp; Once a year a grand match was held, under
the patronage of some saint, to whose church-steeple was affixed the
bird, or semblance of a bird, to be hit by the victor. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp;
The conqueror in the game was Roi des Arbal&eacute;triers for the coming
year, and received a jewelled decoration accordingly, which he was entitled
to wear for twelve months; after which he restored it to the guild,
to be again striven for.&nbsp; The family of him who died during the
year that he was king, were bound to present the decoration to the church
of the patron saint of the guild, and to furnish a similar prize to
be contended for afresh.&nbsp; These noble cross-bow men of the middle
ages formed a sort of armed guard to the powers in existence, and almost
invariably took the aristocratic, in preference to the democratic side,
in the numerous civil dissensions of the Flemish towns.&nbsp; Hence
they were protected by the authorities, and easily obtained favourable
and sheltered sites for their exercise-ground.&nbsp; And thus they came
to occupy the old fosse, and took possession of the great orchard of
the hospital, lying tranquil and sunny in the hollow below the rampart.</p>
<p>But, in the sixteenth century, it became necessary to construct a
street through the exercise-ground of the &ldquo;Arbal&eacute;triers
du Grand Serment,&rdquo; and, after much delay, the company were induced
by the beloved Infanta Isabella to give up the requisite plot of ground.&nbsp;
In recompense for this, Isabella&mdash;who herself was a member of the
guild, and had even shot down the bird, and been queen in 1615&mdash;made
many presents to the arbal&eacute;triers; and, in return, the grateful
city, which had long wanted a nearer road to St. Gudule, but been baffled
by the noble archers, called the street after her name.&nbsp; She, as
a sort of indemnification to the arbal&eacute;triers, caused a &ldquo;great
mansion&rdquo; to be built for their accommodation in the new Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle.&nbsp;
This mansion was placed in front of their exercise-ground, and was of
a square shape.&nbsp; On a remote part of the walls, may still be read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>PHILLIPPO IIII.&nbsp; HISPAN.&nbsp; REGE.&nbsp; ISABELLA-CLARA-EUGENIA
HISPAN.&nbsp; INFANS.&nbsp; MAGN&AElig; GULD&AElig; REGINA GULD&AElig;
FRATRIBUS POSUIT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that mansion were held all the splendid feasts of the Grand Serment
des Arbal&eacute;triers.&nbsp; The master-archer lived there constantly,
in order to be ever at hand to render his services to the guild.&nbsp;
The great saloon was also used for the court balls and festivals, when
the archers were not admitted.&nbsp; The Infanta caused other and smaller
houses to be built in her new street, to serve as residences for her
&ldquo;garde noble;&rdquo; and for her &ldquo;garde bourgeoise,&rdquo;
a small habitation each, some of which still remain, to remind us of
English almshouses.&nbsp; The &ldquo;great mansion,&rdquo; with its
quadrangular form; the spacious saloon&mdash;once used for the archducal
balls, where the dark, grave Spaniards mixed with the blond nobility
of Brabant and Flanders&mdash;now a schoolroom for Belgian girls; the
cross-bow men&rsquo;s archery-ground&mdash;all are there&mdash;the pensionnat
of Madame H&eacute;ger.</p>
<p>This lady was assisted in the work of instruction by her husband&mdash;a
kindly, wise, good, and religious man&mdash;whose acquaintance I am
glad to have made, and who has furnished me with some interesting details,
from his wife&rsquo;s recollections and his own, of the two Miss Bront&euml;s
during their residence in Brussels.&nbsp; He had the better opportunities
of watching them, from his giving lessons in the French language and
literature in the school.&nbsp; A short extract from a letter, written
to me by a French lady resident in Brussels, and well qualified to judge,
will help to show the estimation in which he is held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je ne connais pas personnellement M. H&eacute;ger, mais je
sais qu&rsquo;il est peu de caract&egrave;res aussi nobles, aussi admirables
que le sien.&nbsp; Il est un des membres les plus z&eacute;l&eacute;s
de cette Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de S. Vincent de Paul dont je t&rsquo;ai
d&eacute;j&agrave; parl&eacute;, et ne se contente pas de servir les
pauvres et les malades, mais leur consacre encore les soir&eacute;es.&nbsp;
Apr&egrave;s des journ&eacute;es absorb&eacute;es tout enti&egrave;res
par les devoirs que sa place lui impose, il r&eacute;unit les pauvres,
les ouvriers, leur donne des cours gratuits, et trouve encore le moyen
de les amuser en les instruisant.&nbsp; Ce d&eacute;vouement te dira
assez que M. H&eacute;ger est profondement et ouvertement religieux.&nbsp;
Il a des mani&egrave;res franches et avenantes; il se fait aimer de
tous ceux qui l&rsquo;approchent, et surtout des enfants.&nbsp; Il a
la parole facile, et possde &agrave; un haut degr&eacute; l&rsquo;&eacute;loquence
du bon sens et du coeur.&nbsp; Il n&rsquo;est point auteur.&nbsp; Homme
de z&egrave;le et de conscience, il vient de se d&eacute;mettre des
fonctions &eacute;lev&eacute;es et lucratives qu&rsquo;il exer&ccedil;ait
&agrave; l&rsquo;Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e, celles de Pr&eacute;fet des
Etudes, parce qu&rsquo;il ne peut y r&eacute;aliser le bien qu&rsquo;il
avait esp&eacute;r&eacute;, introduire l&rsquo;enseignement religieux
dans le programme des &eacute;tudes.&nbsp; J&rsquo;ai vu une fois Madame
H&eacute;ger, qui a quelque chose de froid et de compass&eacute; dans
son maintien, et qui pr&eacute;vient peu en sa faveur.&nbsp; Je la crois
pourtant aim&eacute;e et appr&eacute;ci&eacute;e par ses &eacute;l&egrave;ves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were from eighty to a hundred pupils in the pensionnat, when
Charlotte and Emily Bront&euml; entered in February 1842.</p>
<p>M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s account is that they knew nothing of French.&nbsp;
I suspect they knew as much (or as little), for all conversational purposes,
as any English girls do, who have never been abroad, and have only learnt
the idioms and pronunciation from an Englishwoman.&nbsp; The two sisters
clung together, and kept apart from the herd of happy, boisterous, well-befriended
Belgian girls, who, in their turn, thought the new English pupils wild
and scared-looking, with strange, odd, insular ideas about dress; for
Emily had taken a fancy to the fashion, ugly and preposterous even during
its reign, of gigot sleves, and persisted in wearing them long after
they were &ldquo;gone out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her petticoats, too, had not
a curve or a wave in them, but hung down straight and long, clinging
to her lank figure.&nbsp; The sisters spoke to no one but from necessity.&nbsp;
They were too full of earnest thought, and of the exile&rsquo;s sick
yearning, to be ready for careless conversation or merry game.&nbsp;
M. H&eacute;ger, who had done little but observe, during the few first
weeks of their residence in the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle, perceived that
with their unusual characters, and extraordinary talents, a different
mode must be adopted from that in which he generally taught French to
English girls.&nbsp; He seems to have rated Emily&rsquo;s genius as
something even higher than Charlotte&rsquo;s; and her estimation of
their relative powers was the same.&nbsp; Emily had a head for logic,
and a capability of argument, unusual in a man, and rare indeed in a
woman, according to M. H&eacute;ger.&nbsp; Impairing the force of this
gift, was a stubborn tenacity of will, which rendered her obtuse to
all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She should have been a man&mdash;a great navigator,&rdquo; said
M. H&eacute;ger in speaking of her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her powerful reason
would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the
old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by
opposition or difficulty; never have given way but with life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet, moreover, her faculty of imagination was such that, if she
had written a history, her view of scenes and characters would have
been so vivid, and so powerfully expressed, and supported by such a
show of argument, that it would have dominated over the reader, whatever
might have been his previous opinions, or his cooler perceptions of
its truth.&nbsp; But she appeared egotistical and exacting compared
to Charlotte, who was always unselfish (this is M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s
testimony); and in the anxiety of the elder to make her younger sister
contented she allowed her to exercise a kind of unconscious tyranny
over her.</p>
<p>After consulting with his wife, M. H&eacute;ger told them that he
meant to dispense with the old method of grounding in grammar, vocabulary,
&amp;c., and to proceed on a new plan&mdash;something similar to what
he had occasionally adopted with the elder among his French and Belgian
pupils.&nbsp; He proposed to read to them some of the master-pieces
of the most celebrated French authors (such as Casimir de la Vigne&rsquo;s
poem on the &ldquo;Death of Joan of Arc,&rdquo; parts of Bossuet, the
admirable translation of the noble letter of St. Ignatius to the Roman
Christians in the &ldquo;Biblioth&egrave;que Choisie des P&egrave;res
de l&rsquo;Eglise,&rdquo; &amp;c.), and after having thus impressed
the complete effect of the whole, to analyse the parts with them, pointing
out in what such or such an author excelled, and where were the blemishes.&nbsp;
He believed that he had to do with pupils capable, from their ready
sympathy with the intellectual, the refined, the polished, or the noble,
of catching the echo of a style, and so reproducing their own thoughts
in a somewhat similar manner.</p>
<p>After explaining his plan to them, he awaited their reply.&nbsp;
Emily spoke first; and said that she saw no good to be derived from
it; and that, by adopting it, they should lose all originality of thought
and expression.&nbsp; She would have entered into an argument on the
subject, but for this, M. H&eacute;ger had no time.&nbsp; Charlotte
then spoke; she also doubted the success of the plan; but she would
follow out M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s advice, because she was bound to
obey him while she was his pupil.&nbsp; Before speaking of the results,
it may be desirable to give an extract from one of her letters, which
shows some of her first impressions of her new life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brussels, 1842 (May?).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was twenty-six years old a week or two since; and at this
ripe time of life I am a school-girl, and, on the whole, very happy
in that capacity.&nbsp; It felt very strange at first to submit to authority
instead of exercising it&mdash;to obey orders instead of giving them;
but I like that state of things.&nbsp; I returned to it with the same
avidity that a cow, that has long been kept on dry hay, returns to fresh
grass.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t laugh at my simile.&nbsp; It is natural to
me to submit, and very unnatural to command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a large school, in which there are about forty externes,
or day pupils, and twelve pensionnaires, or boarders.&nbsp; Madame H&eacute;ger,
the head, is a lady of precisely the same cast of mind, degree of cultivation,
and quality of intellect as Miss ---.&nbsp; I think the severe points
are a little softened, because she has not been disappointed, and consequently
soured.&nbsp; In a word, she is a married instead of a maiden lady.&nbsp;
There are three teachers in the school&mdash;Mademoiselle Blanche, Mademoiselle
Sophie, and Mademoiselle Marie.&nbsp; The two first have no particular
character.&nbsp; One is an old maid, and the other will be one.&nbsp;
Mademoiselle Marie is talented and original, but of repulsive and arbitrary
manners, which have made the whole school, except myself and Emily,
her bitter enemies.&nbsp; No less than seven masters attend, to teach
the different branches of education&mdash;French, Drawing, Music, Singing,
Writing, Arithmetic, and German.&nbsp; All in the house are Catholics
except ourselves, one other girl, and the gouvernante of Madame&rsquo;s
children, an Englishwoman, in rank something between a lady&rsquo;s
maid and a nursery governess.&nbsp; The difference in country and religion
makes a broad line of demarcation between us and all the rest.&nbsp;
We are completely isolated in the midst of numbers.&nbsp; Yet I think
I am never unhappy; my present life is so delightful, so congenial to
my own nature, compared to that of a governess.&nbsp; My time, constantly
occupied, passes too rapidly.&nbsp; Hitherto both Emily and I have had
good health, and therefore we have been able to work well.&nbsp; There
is one individual of whom I have not yet spoken&mdash;M. H&eacute;ger,
the husband of Madame.&nbsp; He is professor of rhetoric, a man of power
as to mind, but very choleric and irritable in temperament.&nbsp; He
is very angry with me just at present, because I have written a translation
which he chose to stigmatize as &lsquo;<i>peu correct</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He did not tell me so, but wrote the word on the margin of my book,
and asked, in brief stern phrase, how it happened that my compositions
were always better than my translations? adding that the thing seemed
to him inexplicable.&nbsp; The fact is, some weeks ago, in a high-flown
humour, he forbade me to use either dictionary or grammar in translating
the most difficult English compositions into French.&nbsp; This makes
the task rather arduous, and compels me every now and then to introduce
an English word, which nearly plucks the eyes out of his head when he
sees it.&nbsp; Emily and he don&rsquo;t draw well together at all.&nbsp;
Emily works like a horse, and she has had great difficulties to contend
with&mdash;far greater than I have had.&nbsp; Indeed, those who come
to a French school for instruction ought previously to have acquired
a considerable knowledge of the French language, otherwise they will
lose a great deal of time, for the course of instruction is adapted
to natives and not to foreigners; and in these large establishments
they will not change their ordinary course for one or two strangers.&nbsp;
The few private lessons that M. H&eacute;ger has vouchsafed to give
us, are, I suppose, to be considered a great favour; and I can perceive
they have already excited much spite and jealousy in the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will abuse this letter for being short and dreary, and
there are a hundred things which I want to tell you, but I have not
time.&nbsp; Brussels is a beautiful city.&nbsp; The Belgians hate the
English.&nbsp; Their external morality is more rigid than ours.&nbsp;
To lace the stays without a handkerchief on the neck is considered a
disgusting piece of indelicacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passage in this letter where M. H&eacute;ger is represented as
prohibiting the use of dictionary or grammar, refers, I imagine, to
the time I have mentioned, when he determined to adopt a new method
of instruction in the French language, of which they were to catch the
spirit and rhythm rather from the ear and the heart, as its noblest
accents fell upon them, than by over-careful and anxious study of its
grammatical rules.&nbsp; It seems to me a daring experiment on the part
of their teacher; but, doubtless, he knew his ground; and that it answered
is evident in the composition of some of Charlotte&rsquo;s <i>devoirs</i>,
written about this time.&nbsp; I am tempted, in illustration of this
season of mental culture, to recur to a conversation which I had with
M. H&eacute;ger on the manner in which he formed his pupils&rsquo; style,
and to give a proof of his success, by copying a <i>devoir</i> of Charlotte&rsquo;s
with his remarks upon it.</p>
<p>He told me that one day this summer (when the Bront&euml;s had been
for about four months receiving instruction from him) he read to them
Victor Hugo&rsquo;s celebrated portrait of Mirabeau, &ldquo;mais, dans
ma le&ccedil;on je me bornais &agrave; ce qui concerne <i>Mirabeau orateur</i>.&nbsp;
C&rsquo;est apr&egrave;s l&rsquo;analyse de ce morceau, consid&eacute;r&eacute;
surtout du point de vue du fond, de la disposition de ce qu&rsquo;on
pourrait appeler <i>la charpente</i> qu&rsquo;ont &eacute;t&eacute;
faits les deux portraits que je vous donne.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went on
to say that he had pointed out to them the fault in Victor Hugo&rsquo;s
style as being exaggeration in conception, and, at the same time, he
had made them notice the extreme beauty of his &ldquo;nuances&rdquo;
of expression.&nbsp; They were then dismissed to choose the subject
of a similar kind of portrait.&nbsp; This selection M. H&eacute;ger
always left to them; for &ldquo;it is necessary,&rdquo; he observed,
&ldquo;before sitting down to write on a subject, to have thoughts and
feelings about it.&nbsp; I cannot tell on what subject your heart and
mind have been excited.&nbsp; I must leave that to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The marginal comments, I need hardly say, are M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s;
the words in italics are Charlotte&rsquo;s, for which he substitutes
a better form of expression, which is placed between brackets. <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a></p>
<h3>IMITATION.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Le 31 Juillet, 1842.</p>
<p>PORTRAIT DE PIERRE L&rsquo;HERMITE.&nbsp; CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De temps en temps, il para&icirc;t sur la terre des hommes
destin&eacute;s &agrave; &ecirc;tre les instruments [pr&eacute;destin&eacute;s]
{Pourquoi cette suppression?} de grands changements moraux ou politiques.&nbsp;
Quelquefois c&rsquo;est un conqu&eacute;rant, un Alexandre ou un Attila,
qui passe comme un ouragan, et purifie l&rsquo;atmosph&egrave;re moral,
comme l&rsquo;orage purifie l&rsquo;atmosph&egrave;re physique; quelquefois,
c&rsquo;est un r&eacute;volutionnaire, un Cromwell, ou un Robespierre,
qui fait expier par un roi {les fautes et} les vices de toute une dynastie;
quelquefois c&rsquo;est un enthousiaste religieux comme Mahomet, ou
Pierre l&rsquo;Hermite, qui, avec le seul levier de la pens&eacute;e,
soul&egrave;ve des nations enti&egrave;res, les d&eacute;racine et les
transplante dans des climats nouveaux, <i>peuplant l&rsquo;Asie avec
les habitants de l&rsquo;Europe</i>.&nbsp; Pierre l&rsquo;Hermite &eacute;tait
gentilhomme de Picardie, en France, {Invtile, quand vous ecrivez er
fran&ccedil;ais} pourquoi donc n&rsquo;a-t-il pass&eacute; sa vie comma
les autres gentilhommes, ses contemporains, ont pass&eacute; la leur,
&agrave; table, &agrave; la chasse, dans son lit, sans s&rsquo;inqui&eacute;ter
de Saladin, ou de ses Sarrasins?&nbsp; N&rsquo;est-ce pas, parce qu&rsquo;il
y a dans certaines natures, <i>une ardour</i> [un foyer d&rsquo;activit&eacute;]
indomptable qui ne leur permet pas de rester inactives, <i>qui les force
&agrave; se remuer afin d&rsquo;exercer les facultes puissantes, qui
m&ecirc;me en dormant sont pr&ecirc;tes, comme Sampson, &agrave; briser
les noeuds qui les retiennent</i>?</p>
<p>{Vous avez commenc&eacute; &agrave; parler de Pierre: vous &ecirc;tes
entr&eacute;e dans le sujet: marchez au but.}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre prit la profession des armes; <i>si son ardeur avait
&eacute;t&eacute; de cette esp&egrave;ce</i> [s&rsquo;il n&rsquo;avait
eu que cette ardeur vulgaire] qui provient d&rsquo;une robuste sant&eacute;,
<i>il aurait</i> [c&rsquo;eut] &eacute;t&eacute; un brave militaire,
et rien de plus; mais son ardeur &eacute;tait celle de l&rsquo;&acirc;me,
sa flamme &eacute;tait pure et elle s&rsquo;&eacute;levait vers le ciel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sans doute</i> [Il est vrai que] la jeunesse de Pierre
<i>&eacute;tait</i> [f&eacute;t] troubl&eacute;e par passions orageuses;
les natures puissantes sont extr&egrave;mes en tout, elles ne connaissent
la ti&eacute;deur ni dans le bien, ni dans le mal; Pierre donc chercha
d&rsquo;abord avidement la gloire qui se fl&eacute;trit et les plaisirs
qui trompent, mais <i>il fit bient&ocirc;t la d&eacute;couverte</i>
[bient&ocirc;t il s&rsquo;aper&ccedil;ut] que ce qu&rsquo;il poursuivait
n&rsquo;&eacute;tait qe&rsquo;une illusion &agrave; laquelle il ne pourrait
jamais atteindre; {Vnutile, quand vous avez dit illusion} il retourna
donc sur ses pas, il recommen&ccedil;a le voyage de la vie, mais cette
fois il &eacute;vita le chemin spacieux qui m&egrave;ne &agrave; la
perdition et il prit le chemin &eacute;troit qui m&egrave;ne &agrave;
la vie; <i>puisque</i> [comme] le trajet &eacute;tait long et difficile
il jeta la casque et les armes du soldat, et se v&ecirc;tit de l&rsquo;habit
simple du moine.&nbsp; A la vie militaire succ&eacute;da la vie monastique,
car les extr&ecirc;mes se touchent, et <i>chez l&rsquo;homme sinc&egrave;re</i>
la sinc&eacute;rit&eacute; du repentir am&egrave;ne [n&eacute;cessairement
&agrave; la suite] <i>avec lui</i> la rigueur de la p&eacute;nitence.&nbsp;
[Voil&agrave; donc Pierre devenu moine!]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais <i>Pierre</i> [il] avait en lui un principe qui l&rsquo;emp&ecirc;chait
de rester long-temps inactif, ses id&eacute;es, sur quel sujet <i>qu&rsquo;il
soit</i> [que ce f&ucirc;t] ne pouvaient pas &ecirc;tre born&eacute;es;
il ne lui suffisait pas que lui-m&ecirc;me f&ucirc;t religieux, que
lui-m&ecirc;me f&ucirc;t convaincu de la r&eacute;alit&eacute; de Christianism&eacute;
(sic), il fallait que toute l&rsquo;Europe, que toute l&rsquo;Asie,
partage&acirc;t sa conviction et profess&acirc;t la croyance de la Croix.&nbsp;
La Pi&eacute;t&eacute; [fervente] &eacute;lev&eacute;e par la G&eacute;nie,
nourrie par la Solitude, <i>fit na&icirc;tre une esp&egrave;ce d&rsquo;inspiration</i>
[exalta son &acirc;me jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; l&rsquo;inspiration] <i>dans
son ame</i>, et lorsqu&rsquo;il quitta sa cellule et reparut dans le
monde, il portait comme Mo&iuml;se l&rsquo;empreinte de la Divinit&eacute;
sur son front, et <i>tout</i> [tous] reconnurent en lui la v&eacute;ritable
ap&ocirc;tre de la Croix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mahomet n&rsquo;avait jamais remu&eacute; les molles nations
de l&rsquo;Orient comme alors Pierre remua les peuples aust&egrave;res
de l&rsquo;Occident; il fallait que cette &eacute;loquence f&ucirc;t
d&rsquo;une force presque miraculeuse <i>qui pouvait</i> [presqu&rsquo;elle]
persuad<i>er</i> [ait] aux rois de vendre leurs royaumes <i>afin de
procurer</i> [pour avoir] des armes et des soldats <i>pour aider</i>
[&agrave; offrir] &agrave; Pierre dans la guerre sainte qu&rsquo;il
voulait livrer aux infid&egrave;les.&nbsp; La puissance de Pierre [l&rsquo;Hermite]
n&rsquo;&eacute;tait nullement une puissance physique, car la nature,
ou pour mieux dire, Dieu est impartial dans la distribution de ses dons;
il accorde &agrave; l&rsquo;un de ses enfants la gr&acirc;ce, la beaut&eacute;,
les perfections corporelles, &agrave; l&rsquo;autre l&rsquo;esprit,
la grandeur morale.&nbsp; Pierre donc &eacute;tait un homme petit, d&rsquo;une
physionomie peu agr&eacute;able; mais il avait ce courage, cette constance,
cet enthousiasme, cette &eacute;nergie de sentiment qui &eacute;crase
toute opposition, et qui fait que la volont&eacute; d&rsquo;un seul
homme devient la loi de toute une nation.&nbsp; Pour se former une juste
id&eacute;e de l&rsquo;influence qu&rsquo;exer&ccedil;a cet homme sur
les <i>caract&egrave;res</i> [choses] et les id&eacute;es de son temps,
il faut se le repr&eacute;senter au milieu de l&rsquo;arm&eacute;e des

<i>d&rsquo;une</i> [de la] multitude [avide] une multitude qui ne voit
que lui, tandis qui lui, il ne voit que le ciel; ses yeux lev&eacute;s

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dans ce moment le</i> [mais ce] pauvre <i>habit</i> [froc]

non-seulement Pierre voit ces merveilles, mais il les fait voir &agrave;
tous ceux qui l&rsquo;entourent; il ravive l&rsquo;esp&eacute;rance

</blockquote>
<p>As a companion portrait to this, Emily chose to depict Harold on
the eve of the battle of Hastings.&nbsp; It appears to me that her <i>devoir</i>
is superior to Charlotte&rsquo;s in power and in imagination, and fully
equal to it in language; and that this, in both cases, considering how
little practical knowledge of French they had when they arrived at Brussels
in February, and that they wrote without the aid of dictionary or grammar,
is unusual and remarkable.&nbsp; We shall see the progress Charlotte
had made, in ease and grace of style, a year later.</p>
<p>In the choice of subjects left to her selection, she frequently took
characters and scenes from the Old Testament, with which all her writings
show that she was especially familiar.&nbsp; The picturesqueness and
colour (if I may so express it), the grandeur and breadth of its narrations,
impressed her deeply.&nbsp; To use M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s expression,
&ldquo;Elle &eacute;tait nourrie de la Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp; After he
had read De la Vigne&rsquo;s poem on Joan of Arc, she chose the &ldquo;Vision
and Death of Moses on Mount Nebo&rdquo; to write about; and, in looking
over this <i>devoir</i>, I was much struck with one or two of M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s
remarks.&nbsp; After describing, in a quiet and simple manner, the circumstances
under which Moses took leave of the Israelites, her imagination becomes
warmed, and she launches out into a noble strain, depicting the glorious
futurity of the Chosen People, as, looking down upon the Promised Land,
he sees their prosperity in prophetic vision.&nbsp; But, before reaching
the middle of this glowing description, she interrupts herself to discuss
for a moment the doubts that have been thrown on the miraculous relations
of the Old Testament.&nbsp; M. H&eacute;ger remarks, &ldquo;When you
are writing, place your argument first in cool, prosaic language; but
when you have thrown the reins on the neck of your imagination, do not
pull her up to reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, in the vision of Moses, he
sees the maidens leading forth their flocks to the wells at eventide,
and they are described as wearing flowery garlands.&nbsp; Here the writer
is reminded of the necessity of preserving a certain verisimilitude:
Moses might from his elevation see mountains and plains, groups of maidens
and herds of cattle, but could hardly perceive the details of dress,
or the ornaments of the head.</p>
<p>When they had made further progress, M. H&eacute;ger took up a more
advanced plan, that of synthetical teaching.&nbsp; He would read to
them various accounts of the same person or event, and make them notice
the points of agreement and disagreement.&nbsp; Where they were different,
he would make them seek the origin of that difference by causing them
to examine well into the character and position of each separate writer,
and how they would be likely to affect his conception of truth.&nbsp;
For instance, take Cromwell.&nbsp; He would read Bossuet&rsquo;s description
of him in the &ldquo;Oraison Fun&egrave;bre de la Reine d&rsquo;Angleterre,&rdquo;
and show how in this he was considered entirely from the religious point
of view, as an instrument in the hands of God, preordained to His work.&nbsp;
Then he would make them read Guizot, and see how, in this view, Cromwell
was endowed with the utmost power of free-will, but governed by no higher
motive than that of expediency; while Carlyle regarded him as a character
regulated by a strong and conscientious desire to do the will of the
Lord.&nbsp; Then he would desire them to remember that the Royalist
and Commonwealth men had each their different opinions of the great
Protector.&nbsp; And from these conflicting characters, he would require
them to sift and collect the elements of truth, and try to unite them
into a perfect whole.</p>
<p>This kind of exercise delighted Charlotte.&nbsp; It called into play
her powers of analysis, which were extraordinary, and she very soon
excelled in it.</p>
<p>Wherever the Bront&euml;s could be national they were so, with the
same tenacity of attachment which made them suffer as they did whenever
they left Haworth.&nbsp; They were Protestant to the backbone in other
things beside their religion, but pre-eminently so in that.&nbsp; Touched
as Charlotte was by the letter of St. Ignatius before alluded to, she
claimed equal self-devotion, and from as high a motive, for some of
the missionaries of the English Church sent out to toil and to perish
on the poisonous African coast, and wrote as an &ldquo;imitation,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lettre d&rsquo;un Missionnaire, Sierra L&eacute;one, Afrique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of her feeling, too, appears in the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brussels, 1842.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it doubtful whether I shall come home in September
or not.&nbsp; Madame H&eacute;ger has made a proposal for both me and
Emily to stay another half-year, offering to dismiss her English master,
and take me as English teacher; also to employ Emily some part of each
day in teaching music to a certain number of the pupils.&nbsp; For these
services we are to be allowed to continue our studies in French and
German, and to have board, &amp;c., without paying for it; no salaries,
however, are offered.&nbsp; The proposal is kind, and in a great selfish
city like Brussels, and a great selfish school, containing nearly ninety
pupils (boarders and day pupils included), implies a degree of interest
which demands gratitude in return.&nbsp; I am inclined to accept it.&nbsp;
What think you?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t deny I sometimes wish to be in England,
or that I have brief attacks of home sickness; but, on the whole, I
have borne a very valiant heart so far; and I have been happy in Brussels,
because I have always been fully occupied with the employments that
I like.&nbsp; Emily is making rapid progress in French, German, music,
and drawing.&nbsp; Monsieur and Madame H&eacute;ger begin to recognise
the valuable parts of her character, under her singularities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the national character of the Belgians is to be measured
by the character of most of the girls is this school, it in a character
singularly cold, selfish, animal, and inferior.&nbsp; They are very
mutinous and difficult for the teachers to manage; and their principles
are rotten to the core.&nbsp; We avoid them, which it is not difficult
to do, as we have the brand of Protestantism and Anglicism upon us.&nbsp;
People talk of the danger which Protestants expose themselves to in
going to reside in Catholic countries, and thereby running the chance
of changing their faith.&nbsp; My advice to all Protestants who are
tempted to do anything so besotted as turn Catholics, is, to walk over
the sea on to the Continent; to attend mass sedulously for a time; to
note well the mummeries thereof; also the idiotic, mercenary aspect
of all the priests; and then, if they are still disposed to consider
Papistry in any other light than a most feeble, childish piece of humbug,
let them turn Papists at once&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I consider
Methodism, Quakerism, and the extremes of High and Low Churchism foolish,
but Roman Catholicism beats them all.&nbsp; At the same time, allow
me to tell you, that there are some Catholics who are as good as any
Christians can be to whom the Bible is a sealed book, and much better
than many Protestants.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Bront&euml;s first went to Brussels, it was with the intention
of remaining there for six months, or until the <i>grandes vacances</i>
began in September.&nbsp; The duties of the school were then suspended
for six weeks or two months, and it seemed a desirable period for their
return.&nbsp; But the proposal mentioned in the foregoing letter altered
their plans.&nbsp; Besides, they were happy in the feeling that they
were making progress in all the knowledge they had so long been yearning
to acquire.&nbsp; They were happy, too, in possessing friends whose
society had been for years congenial to them, and in occasional meetings
with these, they could have the inexpressible solace to residents in
a foreign country&mdash;and peculiarly such to the Bront&euml;s&mdash;of
talking over the intelligence received from their respective homes&mdash;referring
to past, or planning for future days.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and her
sister, the bright, dancing, laughing Martha, were parlour-boarders
in an establishment just beyond the barriers of Brussels.&nbsp; Again,
the cousins of these friends were resident in the town; and at their
house Charlotte and Emily were always welcome, though their overpowering
shyness prevented their more valuable qualities from being known, and
generally kept them silent.&nbsp; They spent their weekly holiday with
this family, for many months; but at the end of the time, Emily was
as impenetrable to friendly advances as at the beginning; while Charlotte
was too physically weak (as &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; has expressed it) to
&ldquo;gather up her forces&rdquo; sufficiently to express any difference
or opposition of opinion, and had consequently an assenting and deferential
manner, strangely at variance with what they knew of her remarkable
talents and decided character.&nbsp; At this house, the T.&rsquo;s and
the Bront&euml;s could look forward to meeting each other pretty frequently.&nbsp;
There was another English family where Charlotte soon became a welcome
guest, and where, I suspect, she felt herself more at her ease than
either at Mrs. Jenkins&rsquo;, or the friends whom I have first mentioned.</p>
<p>An English physician, with a large family of daughters, went to reside
at Brussels, for the sake of their education.&nbsp; He placed them at
Madame H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s school in July, 1842, not a month before
the beginning of the <i>grandes vacances</i> on August 15th.&nbsp; In
order to make the most of their time, and become accustomed to the language,
these English sisters went daily, through the holidays, to the pensionnat
in the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle.&nbsp; Six or eight boarders remained, besides
the Miss Bront&euml;s.&nbsp; They were there during the whole time,
never even having the break to their monotonous life, which passing
an occasional day with a friend would have afforded them; but devoting
themselves with indefatigable diligence to the different studies in
which they were engaged.&nbsp; Their position in the school appeared,
to these new comers, analogous to what is often called that of a parlour-boarder.&nbsp;
They prepared their French, drawing, German, and literature for their
various masters; and to these occupations Emily added that of music,
in which she was somewhat of a proficient; so much so as to be qualified
to give instruction in it to the three younger sisters of my informant.</p>
<p>The school was divided into three classes.&nbsp; In the first were
from fifteen to twenty pupils; in the second, sixty was about the average
number&mdash;all foreigners, excepting the two Bront&euml;s and one
other; in the third, there were from twenty to thirty pupils.&nbsp;
The first and second classes occupied a long room, divided by a wooden
partition; in each division were four long ranges of desks; and at the
end was the <i>estrade</i>, or platform, for the presiding instructor.&nbsp;
On the last row, in the quietest corner, sat Charlotte and Emily, side
by side, so deeply absorbed in their studies as to be insensible to
any noise or movement around them.&nbsp; The school-hours were from
nine to twelve (the luncheon hour), when the boarders and half-boarders&mdash;perhaps
two-and-thirty girls&mdash;went to the refectoire (a room with two long
tables, having an oil-lamp suspended over each), to partake of bread
and fruit; the <i>externes</i>, or morning pupils, who had brought their
own refreshment with them, adjourning to eat it in the garden.&nbsp;
From one to two, there was fancy-work&mdash;a pupil reading aloud some
light literature in each room; from two to four, lessons again.&nbsp;
At four, the externes left; and the remaining girls dined in the refectoire,
M. and Madame H&eacute;ger presiding.&nbsp; From five to six there was
recreation, from six to seven, preparation for lessons; and, after that
succeeded the <i>lecture pieuse</i>&mdash;Charlotte&rsquo;s nightmare.&nbsp;
On rare occasions, M. H&eacute;ger himself would come in, and substitute
a book of a different and more interesting kind.&nbsp; At eight, there
was a slight meal of water and <i>pistolets</i> (the delicious little
Brussels rolls), which was immediately followed by prayers, and then
to bed.</p>
<p>The principal bedroom was over the long classe, or schoolroom.&nbsp;
There were six or eight narrow beds on each side of the apartment, every
one enveloped in its white draping curtain; a long drawer, beneath each,
served for a wardrobe, and between each was a stand for ewer, basin,
and looking-glass.&nbsp; The beds of the two Miss Bront&euml;s were
at the extreme end of the room, almost as private and retired as if
they had been in a separate apartment.</p>
<p>During the hours of recreation, which were always spent in the garden,
they invariably walked together, and generally kept a profound silence;
Emily, though so much the taller, leaning on her sister.&nbsp; Charlotte
would always answer when spoken to, taking the lead in replying to any
remark addressed to both; Emily rarely spoke to any one.&nbsp; Charlotte&rsquo;s
quiet, gentle manner never changed.&nbsp; She was never seen out of
temper for a moment; and occasionally, when she herself had assumed
the post of English teacher, and the impertinence or inattention of
her pupils was most irritating, a slight increase of colour, a momentary
sparkling of the eye, and more decided energy of manner, were the only
outward tokens she gave of being conscious of the annoyance to which
she was subjected.&nbsp; But this dignified endurance of hers subdued
her pupils, in the long run, far more than the voluble tirades of the
other mistresses.&nbsp; My informant adds:&mdash;&ldquo;The effect of
this manner was singular.&nbsp; I can speak from personal experience.&nbsp;
I was at that time high-spirited and impetuous, not respecting the French
mistresses; yet, to my own astonishment, at one word from her, I was
perfectly tractable; so much so, that at length, M. and Madame H&eacute;ger
invariably preferred all their wishes to me through her; the other pupils
did not, perhaps, love her as I did, she was so quiet and silent; but
all respected her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the exception of that part which describes Charlotte&rsquo;s
manner as English teacher&mdash;an office which she did not assume for
some months later&mdash;all this description of the school life of the
two Bront&euml;s refers to the commencement of the new scholastic year
in October 1842; and the extracts I have given convey the first impression
which the life at a foreign school, and the position of the two Miss
Bront&euml;s therein, made upon an intelligent English girl of sixteen.&nbsp;
I will make a quotation from &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo; letter referring
to this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first part of her time at Brussels was not uninteresting.&nbsp;
She spoke of new people and characters, and foreign ways of the pupils
and teachers.&nbsp; She knew the hopes and prospects of the teachers,
and mentioned one who was very anxious to marry, &lsquo;she was getting
so old.&rsquo;&nbsp; She used to get her father or brother (I forget
which) to be the bearer of letters to different single men, who she
thought might be persuaded to do her the favour, saying that her only
resource was to become a sister of charity if her present employment
failed and that she hated the idea.&nbsp; Charlotte naturally looked
with curiosity to people of her own condition.&nbsp; This woman almost
frightened her.&nbsp; &lsquo;She declares there is nothing she can turn
to, and laughs at the idea of delicacy,&mdash;and she is only ten years
older than I am!&rsquo;&nbsp; I did not see the connection till she
said, &lsquo;Well, Polly, I should hate being a sister of charity; I
suppose that would shock some people, but I should.&rsquo;&nbsp; I thought
she would have as much feeling as a nurse as most people, and more than
some.&nbsp; She said she did not know how people could bear the constant
pressure of misery, and never to change except to a new form of it.&nbsp;
It would be impossible to keep one&rsquo;s natural feelings.&nbsp; I
promised her a better destiny than to go begging any one to marry her,
or to lose her natural feelings as a sister of charity.&nbsp; She said,
&lsquo;My youth is leaving me; I can never do better than I have done,
and I have done nothing yet.&rsquo;&nbsp; At such times she seemed to
think that most human beings were destined by the pressure of worldly
interests to lose one faculty and feeling after another &lsquo;till
they went dead altogether.&nbsp; I hope I shall be put in my grave as
soon as I&rsquo;m dead; I don&rsquo;t want to walk about so.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Here we always differed.&nbsp; I thought the degradation of nature she
feared was a consequence of poverty, and that she should give her attention
to earning money.&nbsp; Sometimes she admitted this, but could find
no means of earning money.&nbsp; At others she seemed afraid of letting
her thoughts dwell on the subject, saying it brought on the worst palsy
of all.&nbsp; Indeed, in her position, nothing less than entire constant
absorption in petty money matters could have scraped together a provision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course artists and authors stood high with Charlotte, and
the best thing after their works would have been their company.&nbsp;
She used very inconsistently to rail at money and money-getting, and
then wish she was able to visit all the large towns in Europe, see all
the sights and know all the celebrities.&nbsp; This was her notion of
literary fame,&mdash;a passport to the society of clever people . .
. When she had become acquainted with the people and ways at Brussels
her life became monotonous, and she fell into the same hopeless state
as at Miss W---&rsquo;s, though in a less degree.&nbsp; I wrote to her,
urging her to go home or elsewhere; she had got what she wanted (French),
and there was at least novelty in a new place, if no improvement.&nbsp;
That if she sank into deeper gloom she would soon not have energy to
go, and she was too far from home for her friends to hear of her condition
and order her home as they had done from Miss W---&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She
wrote that I had done her a great service, that she should certainly
follow my advice, and was much obliged to me.&nbsp; I have often wondered
at this letter.&nbsp; Though she patiently tolerated advice, she could
always quietly put it aside, and do as she thought fit.&nbsp; More than
once afterwards she mentioned the &lsquo;service&rsquo; I had done her.&nbsp;
She sent me 10<i>l</i>. to New Zealand, on hearing some exaggerated
accounts of my circumstances, and told me she hoped it would come in
seasonably; it was a debt she owed me &lsquo;for the service I had done
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should think 10<i>l</i>. was a quarter of her income.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;service&rsquo; was mentioned as an apology, but kindness
was the real motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first break in this life of regular duties and employments came
heavily and sadly.&nbsp; Martha&mdash;pretty, winning, mischievous,
tricksome Martha&mdash;was taken ill suddenly at the Ch&acirc;teau de
Koekelberg.&nbsp; Her sister tended her with devoted love; but it was
all in vain; in a few days she died.&nbsp; Charlotte&rsquo;s own short
account of this event is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha T.&rsquo;s illness was unknown to me till the day before
she died.&nbsp; I hastened to Koekelberg the next morning&mdash;unconscious
that she was in great danger&mdash;and was told that it was finished.&nbsp;
She had died in the night.&nbsp; Mary was taken away to Bruxelles.&nbsp;
I have seen Mary frequently since.&nbsp; She is in no ways crushed by
the event; but while Martha was ill, she was to her more than a mother&mdash;more
than a sister: watching, nursing, cherishing her so tenderly, so unweariedly.&nbsp;
She appears calm and serious now; no bursts of violent emotion; no exaggeration
of distress.&nbsp; I have seen Martha&rsquo;s grave&mdash;the place
where her ashes lie in a foreign country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who that has read &ldquo;Shirley&rdquo; does not remember the few
lines&mdash;perhaps half a page&mdash;of sad recollection?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He has no idea that little Jessy will die young,
she is so gay, and chattering, and arch&mdash;original even now; passionate
when provoked, but most affectionate if caressed; by turns gentle and
rattling; exacting yet generous; fearless . . . yet reliant on any who
will help her.&nbsp; Jessy, with her little piquant face, engaging prattle,
and winning ways, is made to be a pet.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this place?&nbsp; No, you never saw it; but you
recognise the nature of these trees, this foliage&mdash;the cypress,
the willow, the yew.&nbsp; Stone crosses like these are not unfamiliar
to you, nor are these dim garlands of everlasting flowers.&nbsp; Here
is the place: green sod and a grey marble head-stone&mdash;Jessy sleeps
below.&nbsp; She lived through an April day; much loved was she, much
loving.&nbsp; She often, in her brief life, shed tears&mdash;she had
frequent sorrows; she smiled between, gladdening whatever saw her.&nbsp;
Her death was tranquil and happy in Rose&rsquo;s guardian arms, for
Rose had been her stay and defence through many trials; the dying and
the watching English girls were at that hour alone in a foreign country,
and the soil of that country gave Jessy a grave.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jessy, I will write about you no more.&nbsp; This is
an autumn evening, wet and wild.&nbsp; There is only one cloud in the
sky; but it curtains it from pole to pole.&nbsp; The wind cannot rest;
it hurries sobbing over hills of sullen outline, colourless with twilight
and mist.&nbsp; Rain has beat all day on that church tower&rdquo; (Haworth):
&ldquo;it rises dark from the stony enclosure of its graveyard: the
nettles, the long grass, and the tombs all drip with wet.&nbsp; This
evening reminds me too forcibly of another evening some years ago: a
howling, rainy autumn evening too&mdash;when certain who had that day
performed a pilgrimage to a grave new made in a heretic cemetery, sat
near a wood fire on the hearth of a foreign dwelling.&nbsp; They were
merry and social, but they each knew that a gap, never to be filled,
had been made in their circle.&nbsp; They knew they had lost something
whose absence could never be quite atoned for, so long as they lived;
and they knew that heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth
which covered their lost darling; and that the sad, sighing gale was
mourning above her buried head.&nbsp; The fire warmed them; Life and
Friendship yet blessed them: but Jessy lay cold, coffined, solitary&mdash;only
the sod screening her from the storm.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first death that had occurred in the small circle of
Charlotte&rsquo;s immediate and intimate friends since the loss of her
two sisters long ago.&nbsp; She was still in the midst of her deep sympathy
with &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; when word came from home that her aunt, Miss
Branwell, was ailing&mdash;was very ill.&nbsp; Emily and Charlotte immediately
resolved to go home straight, and hastily packed up for England, doubtful
whether they should ever return to Brussels or not, leaving all their
relations with M. and Madame H&eacute;ger, and the pensionnat, uprooted,
and uncertain of any future existence.&nbsp; Even before their departure,
on the morning after they received the first intelligence of illness&mdash;when
they were on the very point of starting&mdash;came a second letter,
telling them of their aunt&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; It could not hasten
their movements, for every arrangement had been made for speed.&nbsp;
They sailed from Antwerp; they travelled night and day, and got home
on a Tuesday morning.&nbsp; The funeral and all was over, and Mr. Bront&euml;
and Anne were sitting together, in quiet grief for the loss of one who
had done her part well in their household for nearly twenty years, and
earned the regard and respect of many who never knew how much they should
miss her till she was gone.&nbsp; The small property which she had accumulated,
by dint of personal frugality and self-denial, was bequeathed to her
nieces.&nbsp; Branwell, her darling, was to have had his share; but
his reckless expenditure had distressed the good old lady, and his name
was omitted in her will.</p>
<p>When the first shock was over, the three sisters began to enjoy the
full relish of meeting again, after the longest separation they had
had in their lives.&nbsp; They had much to tell of the past, and much
to settle for the future.&nbsp; Anne had been for some little time in
a situation, to which she was to return at the end of the Christmas
holidays.&nbsp; For another year or so they were again to be all three
apart; and, after that, the happy vision of being together and opening
a school was to be realised.&nbsp; Of course they did not now look forward
to settling at Burlington, or any other place which would take them
away from their father; but the small sum which they each independently
possessed would enable them to effect such alterations in the parsonage-house
at Haworth as would adapt it to the reception of pupils.&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s
plans for the interval were fixed.&nbsp; Emily quickly decided to be
the daughter to remain at home.&nbsp; About Charlotte there was much
deliberation and some discussion.</p>
<p>Even in all the haste of their sudden departure from Brussels, M.
H&eacute;ger had found time to write a letter of sympathy to Mr. Bront&euml;
on the loss which he had just sustained; a letter containing such a
graceful appreciation of the daughters&rsquo; characters, under the
form of a tribute of respect to their father, that I should have been
tempted to copy it, even had there not also been a proposal made in
it respecting Charlotte, which deserves a place in the record of her
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;En perdant nos deux ch&eacute;res &eacute;l&eacute;ves, nous
ne devons pas vous cacher que nous &eacute;prouvons &agrave; la fois
et du chagrin et de l&rsquo;inqui&eacute;tude; nous sommes afflig&eacute;s
parce que cette brusque s&eacute;paration vient briser l&rsquo;affection
presque paternelle que nous leur avons vou&eacute;e, et notre peine
s&rsquo;augmente &agrave; la vue de tant de travaux interrompues, de
tant de choses bien commenc&eacute;es, et qui ne demandent que quelque
temps encore pour &ecirc;tre men&eacute;es &agrave; bonne fin.&nbsp;
Dans un an, chacune de vos demoiselles e&ucirc;t &eacute;t&eacute; enti&egrave;rement
pr&eacute;munie contre les &eacute;ventualit&eacute;s de l&rsquo;avenir;
chacune d&rsquo;elles acqu&eacute;rait &agrave; la fois et l&rsquo;instruction
et la science d&rsquo;enseignement; Mlle Emily allait apprendre le piano;
recevoir les le&ccedil;ons du meilleur professeur que nous ayons en
Belgique, et d&eacute;j&agrave; elle avait elle-m&ecirc;me de petites
&eacute;l&egrave;ves; elle perdait donc &agrave; la fois un reste d&rsquo;ignorance
et un reste plus g&ecirc;nant encore de timidit&eacute;; Mlle Charlotte
commen&ccedil;ait &agrave; donner des le&ccedil;ons en fran&ccedil;ais,
et d&rsquo;acqu&eacute;rir cette assurance, cet aplomb si n&eacute;cessaire
dans l&rsquo;enseignement; encore un an tout au plus et l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre
&eacute;tait achev&eacute;e et bien achev&eacute;e.&nbsp; Alors nous
aurions pu, si cela vous e&ucirc;t convenu, offrir &agrave; mesdemoiselles
vos filles ou du moins &agrave; l&rsquo;une des deux une position qui
e&ucirc;t &eacute;t&eacute; dans ses go&ugrave;ts, et qui lui e&ucirc;t
donn&eacute; cette douce ind&eacute;pendance si difficile &agrave; trouver
pour une jeune personne.&nbsp; Ce n&rsquo;est pas, croyez le bien, Monsieur,
ce n&rsquo;est pas ici pour nous une question d&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
personnel, c&rsquo;est une question d&rsquo;affection; vous me pardonnerez
si nous vous parlons de vos enfants, si nous nous occupons de leur avenir,
comme si elles faisaient partie de notre famille; leurs qualit&eacute;s
personnelles, leur bon vouloir, leur z&egrave;le extr&ecirc;me sont
les seules causes qui nous poussent &agrave; nous hasarder de la sorte.&nbsp;
Nous savons, Monsieur, que vous peserez plus m&ucirc;rement et plus
sagement que nous la cons&eacute;quence qu&rsquo;aurait pour l&rsquo;avenir
une interruption compl&egrave;te dans les &eacute;tudes de vos deux
filles; vous d&eacute;ciderez ce qu&rsquo;il faut faire, et vous nous
pardonnerez notre franchise, si vous daignez consid&eacute;rer que le
motif qui nous fait agir est une affection bien d&eacute;sint&eacute;ress&eacute;e
et qui s&rsquo;affligerait beaucoup de devoir d&eacute;j&agrave; se
r&eacute;signer &agrave; n&rsquo;&ecirc;tre plus utile &agrave; vos
chers enfants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agr&eacute;ez, je vous prie, Monsieur, l&rsquo;expression
respectueuse de mes sentiments de haute consid&eacute;ration.</p>

<p>There was so much truth, as well as so much kindness in this letter&mdash;it
was so obvious that a second year of instruction would be far more valuable
than the first, that there was no long hesitation before it was decided
that Charlotte should return to Brussels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they enjoyed their Christmas all together inexpressibly.&nbsp;
Branwell was with them; that was always a pleasure at this time; whatever
might be his faults, or even his vices, his sisters yet held him up
as their family hope, as they trusted that he would some day be their
family pride.&nbsp; They blinded themselves to the magnitude of the
failings of which they were now and then told, by persuading themselves
that such failings were common to all men of any strength of character;
for, till sad experience taught them better, they fell into the usual
error of confounding strong passions with strong character.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s friend came over to see her, and she returned the
visit.&nbsp; Her Brussels life must have seemed like a dream, so completely,
in this short space of time, did she fall back into the old household
ways; with more of household independence than she could ever have had
during her aunt&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp; Winter though it was, the sisters
took their accustomed walks on the snow-covered moors; or went often
down the long road to Keighley, for such books as had been added to
the library there during their absence from England.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>Towards the end of January, the time came for Charlotte to return
to Brussels.&nbsp; Her journey thither was rather disastrous.&nbsp;
She had to make her way alone; and the train from Leeds to London, which
should have reached Euston-square early in the afternoon, was so much
delayed that it did not get in till ten at night.&nbsp; She had intended
to seek out the Chapter Coffee-house, where she had stayed before, and
which would have been near the place where the steam-boats lay; but
she appears to have been frightened by the idea of arriving at an hour
which, to Yorkshire notions, was so late and unseemly; and taking a
cab, therefore, at the station, she drove straight to the London Bridge
Wharf, and desired a waterman to row her to the Ostend packet, which
was to sail the next morning.&nbsp; She described to me, pretty much
as she has since described it in &ldquo;Villette,&rdquo; her sense of
loneliness, and yet her strange pleasure in the excitement of the situation,
as in the dead of that winter&rsquo;s night she went swiftly over the
dark river to the black hull&rsquo;s side, and was at first refused
leave to ascend to the deck.&nbsp; &ldquo;No passengers might sleep
on board,&rdquo; they said, with some appearance of disrespect.&nbsp;
She looked back to the lights and subdued noises of London&mdash;that
&ldquo;Mighty Heart&rdquo; in which she had no place&mdash;and, standing
up in the rocking boat, she asked to speak to some one in authority
on board the packet.&nbsp; He came, and her quiet simple statement of
her wish, and her reason for it, quelled the feeling of sneering distrust
in those who had first heard her request; and impressed the authority
so favourably that he allowed her to come on board, and take possession
of a berth.&nbsp; The next morning she sailed; and at seven on Sunday
evening she reached the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle once more; having only
left Haworth on Friday morning at an early hour.</p>
<p>Her salary was 16<i>l</i>. a year; out of which she had to pay for
her German lessons, for which she was charged as much (the lessons being
probably rated by time) as when Emily learnt with her and divided the
expense, viz., ten francs a month.&nbsp; By Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
own desire, she gave her English lessons in the <i>classe</i>, or schoolroom,
without the supervision of Madame or M. H&eacute;ger.&nbsp; They offered
to be present, with a view to maintain order among the unruly Belgian
girls; but she declined this, saying that she would rather enforce discipline
by her own manner and character than be indebted for obedience to the
presence of a <i>gendarme</i>.&nbsp; She ruled over a new schoolroom,
which had been built on the space in the play-ground adjoining the house.&nbsp;
Over that First Class she was <i>surveillante</i> at all hours; and
henceforward she was called <i>Mademoiselle</i> Charlotte by M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s
orders.&nbsp; She continued her own studies, principally attending to
German, and to Literature; and every Sunday she went alone to the German
and English chapels.&nbsp; Her walks too were solitary, and principally
taken in the all&eacute;e d&eacute;fendue, where she was secure from
intrusion.&nbsp; This solitude was a perilous luxury to one of her temperament;
so liable as she was to morbid and acute mental suffering.</p>
<p>On March 6th, 1843, she writes thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am settled by this time, of course.&nbsp; I
am not too much overloaded with occupation; and besides teaching English,
I have time to improve myself in German.&nbsp; I ought to consider myself
well off, and to be thankful for my good fortunes.&nbsp; I hope I am
thankful; and if I could always keep up my spirits and never feel lonely,
or long for companionship, or friendship, or whatever they call it,
I should do very well.&nbsp; As I told you before, M. and Madame H&eacute;ger
are the only two persons in the house for whom I really experience regard
and esteem, and of course, I cannot be always with them, nor even very
often.&nbsp; They told me, when I first returned, that I was to consider
their sitting-room my sitting-room also, and to go there whenever I
was not engaged in the schoolroom.&nbsp; This, however, I cannot do.&nbsp;
In the daytime it is a public room, where music-masters and mistresses
are constantly passing in and out; and in the evening, I will not, and
ought not to intrude on M. and Madame H&eacute;ger and their children.&nbsp;
Thus I am a good deal by myself, out of school-hours; but that does
not signify.&nbsp; I now regularly give English lessons to M. H&eacute;ger
and his brother-in-law.&nbsp; They get on with wonderful rapidity; especially
the first.&nbsp; He already begins to speak English very decently.&nbsp;
If you could see and hear the efforts I make to teach them to pronounce
like Englishmen, and their unavailing attempts to imitate, you would
laugh to all eternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Carnival is just over, and we have entered upon the gloom
and abstinence of Lent.&nbsp; The first day of Lent we had coffee without
milk for breakfast; vinegar and vegetables, with a very little salt
fish, for dinner; and bread for supper.&nbsp; The Carnival was nothing
but masking and mummery.&nbsp; M. H&eacute;ger took me and one of the
pupils into the town to see the masks.&nbsp; It was animating to see
the immense crowds, and the general gaiety, but the masks were nothing.&nbsp;
I have been twice to the D.&rsquo;s&rdquo; (those cousins of &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo;
of whom I have before made mention).&nbsp; &ldquo;When she leaves Bruxelles,
I shall have nowhere to go to.&nbsp; I have had two letters from Mary.&nbsp;
She does not tell me she has been ill, and she does not complain; but
her letters are not the letters of a person in the enjoyment of great
happiness.&nbsp; She has nobody to be as good to her as M. H&eacute;ger
is to me; to lend her books; to converse with her sometimes, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&nbsp; When I say so, it seems to me that you will
hardly hear me; all the waves of the Channel heaving and roaring between
must deaden the sound.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the tone of this letter, it may easily be perceived that the
Brussels of 1843 was a different place from that of 1842.&nbsp; Then
she had Emily for a daily and nightly solace and companion.&nbsp; She
had the weekly variety of a visit to the family of the D.s; and she
had the frequent happiness of seeing &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and Martha.&nbsp;
Now Emily was far away in Haworth&mdash;where she or any other loved
one, might die, before Charlotte, with her utmost speed, could reach
them, as experience, in her aunt&rsquo;s case, had taught her.&nbsp;
The D.s were leaving Brussels; so, henceforth, her weekly holiday would
have to be passed in the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle, or so she thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mary&rdquo; was gone off on her own independent course; Martha
alone remained&mdash;still and quiet for ever, in the cemetery beyond
the Porte de Louvain.&nbsp; The weather, too, for the first few weeks
after Charlotte&rsquo;s return, had been piercingly cold; and her feeble
constitution was always painfully sensitive to an inclement season.&nbsp;
Mere bodily pain, however acute, she could always put aside; but too
often ill-health assailed her in a part far more to be dreaded.&nbsp;
Her depression of spirits, when she was not well, was pitiful in its
extremity.&nbsp; She was aware that it was constitutional, and could
reason about it; but no reasoning prevented her suffering mental agony,
while the bodily cause remained in force.</p>
<p>The H&eacute;gers have discovered, since the publication of &ldquo;Villette,&rdquo;
that at this beginning of her career as English teacher in their school,
the conduct of her pupils was often impertinent and mutinous in the
highest degree.&nbsp; But of this they were unaware at the time, as
she had declined their presence, and never made any complaint.&nbsp;
Still it must have been a depressing thought to her at this period,
that her joyous, healthy, obtuse pupils were so little answerable to
the powers she could bring to bear upon them; and though from their
own testimony, her patience, firmness, and resolution, at length obtained
their just reward, yet with one so weak in health and spirits, the reaction
after such struggles as she frequently had with her pupils, must have
been very sad and painful.</p>
<p>She thus writes to her friend E.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;April, 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any talk of your coming to Brussels?&nbsp; During
the bitter cold weather we had through February, and the principal part
of March, I did not regret that you had not accompanied me.&nbsp; If
I had seen you shivering as I shivered myself, if I had seen your hands
and feet as red and swelled as mine were, my discomfort would just have
been doubled.&nbsp; I can do very well under this sort of thing; it
does not fret me; it only makes me numb and silent; but if you were
to pass a winter in Belgium, you would be ill.&nbsp; However, more genial
weather is coming now, and I wish you were here.&nbsp; Yet I never have
pressed you, and never would press you too warmly to come.&nbsp; There
are privations and humiliations to submit to; there is monotony and
uniformity of life; and, above all, there is a constant sense of solitude
in the midst of numbers.&nbsp; The Protestant, the foreigner, is a solitary
being, whether as teacher or pupil.&nbsp; I do not say this by way of
complaining of my own lot; for though I acknowledge that there are certain
disadvantages in my present position, what position on earth is without
them?&nbsp; And, whenever I turn back to compare what I am with what
I was&mdash;my place here with my place at Mrs. ---&rsquo;s for instance&mdash;I
am thankful.&nbsp; There was an observation in your last letter which
excited, for a moment, my wrath.&nbsp; At first, I thought it would
be folly to reply to it, and I would let it die.&nbsp; Afterwards, I
determined to give one answer, once for all.&nbsp; &lsquo;Three or four
people,&rsquo; it seems, &lsquo;have the idea that the future <i>&eacute;poux</i>
of Mademoiselle Bront&euml; is on the Continent.&rsquo;&nbsp; These
people are wiser than I am.&nbsp; They could not believe that I crossed
the sea merely to return as teacher to Madame H&eacute;gers.&nbsp; I
must have some more powerful motive than respect for my master and mistress,
gratitude for their kindness, &amp;c., to induce me to refuse a salary
of 50<i>l</i>. in England, and accept one of 16<i>l</i>. in Belgium.&nbsp;
I must, forsooth, have some remote hope of entrapping a husband somehow,
or somewhere.&nbsp; If these charitable people knew the total seclusion
of the life I lead,&mdash;that I never exchange a word with any other
man than Monsieur H&eacute;ger, and seldom indeed with him,&mdash;they
would, perhaps, cease to suppose that any such chimerical and groundless
notion had influenced my proceedings.&nbsp; Have I said enough to clear
myself of so silly an imputation?&nbsp; Not that it is a crime to marry,
or a crime to wish to be married; but it is an imbecility, which I reject
with contempt, for women, who have neither fortune nor beauty, to make
marriage the principal object of their wishes and hopes, and the aim
of all their actions; not to be able to convince themselves that they
are unattractive, and that they had better be quiet, and think of other
things than wedlock.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is an extract, from one of the few letters which have
been preserved, of her correspondence with her sister Emily:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May 29, 1843</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get on here from day to day in a Robinson-Crusoe-like sort
of way, very lonely, but that does not signify.&nbsp; In other respects,
I have nothing substantial to complain of, nor is this a cause for complaint.&nbsp;
I hope you are well.&nbsp; Walk out often on the moors.&nbsp; My love
to Tabby.&nbsp; I hope she keeps well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And about this time she wrote to her father,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 2nd, 1818,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very glad to hear from home.&nbsp; I had begun to get
low-spirited at not receiving any news, and to entertain indefinite
fears that something was wrong.&nbsp; You do not say anything about
your own health, but I hope you are well, and Emily also.&nbsp; I am
afraid she will have a good deal of hard work to do now that Hannah&rdquo;
(a servant-girl who had been assisting Tabby) &ldquo;is gone.&nbsp;
I am exceedingly glad to hear that you still keep Tabby&rdquo; (considerably
upwards of seventy).&nbsp; &ldquo;It is an act of great charity to her,
and I do not think it will be unrewarded, for she is very faithful,
and will always serve you, when she has occasion, to the best of her
abilities; besides, she will be company for Emily, who, without her,
would be very lonely.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I gave a <i>devoir</i>, written after she had been four months under
M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s tuition.&nbsp; I will now copy out another,
written nearly a year later, during which the progress made appears
to me very great.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;31 Mai, 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SUR LA MORT DE NAPOL&Eacute;ON.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Napol&eacute;on naquit en Corse et mourut &agrave; Ste. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne.&nbsp;
Entre ces deux &icirc;les rien qu&rsquo;un vaste et br&ucirc;lant d&eacute;sert
et l&rsquo;oc&eacute;an immense.&nbsp; Il naquit fils d&rsquo;un simple
gentilhomme, et mourut empereur, mais sans couronne et dans les fers.&nbsp;
Entre son berceau et sa tombe qu&rsquo;y a-t-il? la carri&egrave;re
d&rsquo;un soldat parvenu, des champs de bataille, une mer de sang,
un tr&ocirc;ne, puis du sang encore, et des fers.&nbsp; Sa vie, c&rsquo;est
l&rsquo;arc en ciel; les deux points extr&ecirc;mes touchent la terre,
la comble lumi-neuse mesure les cieux.&nbsp; Sur Napol&eacute;on au
berceau une m&egrave;re brillait; dans la maison paternelle il avait
des fr&egrave;res et des soeurs; plus tard dans son palais il eut une
femme qui l&rsquo;aimait.&nbsp; Mais sur son lit de mort Napol&eacute;on
est seul; plus de m&egrave;re, ni de fr&egrave;re, ni de soeur, ni de
femme, ni d&rsquo;enfant!!&nbsp; D&rsquo;autres ont dit et rediront
ses exploits, moi, je m&rsquo;arr&ecirc;te &agrave; contempler l&rsquo;abandonnement
de sa derni&egrave;re heure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Il est l&agrave;, exil&eacute; et captif, encha&icirc;n&eacute;
sur un &eacute;cueil.&nbsp; Nouveau Prom&eacute;th&eacute;e il subit
le ch&acirc;timent de son orgueil!&nbsp; Prom&eacute;th&eacute;e avait
voulu &ecirc;tre Dieu et Cr&eacute;ateur; il d&eacute;roba le feu du
Ciel pour animer le corps qu&rsquo;il avait form&eacute;.&nbsp; Et lui,
Buonaparte, il a voulu cr&eacute;er, non pas un homme, mais un empire,
et pour donner une existence, une &acirc;me, &agrave; son &oelig;uvre
gigantesque, il n&rsquo;a pas h&eacute;sit&eacute; &agrave; arracher
la vie &agrave; des nations enti&egrave;res.&nbsp; Jupiter indign&eacute;
de l&rsquo;impi&eacute;t&eacute; de Prom&eacute;th&eacute;e, le riva
vivant &agrave; la cime du Caucase.&nbsp; Ainsi, pour punir l&rsquo;ambition
rapace de Buonaparte, la Providence l&rsquo;a encha&icirc;n&eacute;,
jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; ce que la mort s&rsquo;en suivit, sur un roc isol&eacute;
de l&rsquo;Atlantique.&nbsp; Peut-&ecirc;tre l&agrave; aussi a-t-il
senti lui fouillant le flanc cet insatiable vautour dont parle la fable,
peut-&ecirc;tre a-t-il souffert aussi cette soif du coeur, cette faim
de l&rsquo;&acirc;me, qui torturent l&rsquo;exil&eacute;, loin de sa
famille et de sa patrie.&nbsp; Mais parler ainsi n&rsquo;est-ce pas
attribuer gratuitement &agrave; Napol&eacute;on une humaine faiblesse
qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;&eacute;prouva jamais?&nbsp; Quand donc s&rsquo;est-il
laiss&eacute; encha&icirc;ner par un lien d&rsquo;affection?&nbsp; Sans
doute d&rsquo;autres conqu&eacute;rants ont h&eacute;sit&eacute; dans
leur carri&egrave;re de gloire, arr&ecirc;t&eacute;s par un obstacle
d&rsquo;amour ou d&rsquo;amiti&eacute;, retenus par la main d&rsquo;une
femme, rapp&eacute;les par la voix d&rsquo;un ami&mdash;lui, jamais!&nbsp;
Il n&rsquo;eut pas besoin, comme Ulysse, de se lier au m&acirc;t du
navire, ni de se boucher les oreilles avec de la cire; il ne redoutait
pas le chant des Sir&egrave;nes&mdash;il le d&eacute;daignait; il se
fit marbre et fer pour ex&eacute;cuter ses grands projets.&nbsp; Napol&eacute;on
ne se regardait pas comme un homme, mais comme l&rsquo;incarnation d&rsquo;un
peuple.&nbsp; Il n&rsquo;aimait pas; il ne consid&eacute;rait ses amis
et ses proches que comme des instruments auxquels il tint, tant qu&rsquo;ils
furent utiles, et qu&rsquo;il jeta de c&ocirc;t&eacute; quand ils cess&egrave;rent
de l&rsquo;&ecirc;tre.&nbsp; Qu&rsquo;on ne se permette donc pas d&rsquo;approcher
du s&eacute;pulcre du Corse avec sentiments de piti&eacute;, ou de souiller
de larmes la pierre qui couvre ses restes, son &acirc;me r&eacute;pudierait
tout cela.&nbsp; On a dit, je le sais, qu&rsquo;elle fut cruelle la
main qui le s&eacute;para de sa femme et de son enfant.&nbsp; Non, c&rsquo;&eacute;tait
une main qui, comme la sienne, ne tremblait ni de passion ni de crainte,
c&rsquo;&eacute;tait la main d&rsquo;un homme froid, convaincu, qui
avait su deviner Buonaparte; et voici ce que disait cet homme que la
d&eacute;faite n&rsquo;a pu humilier, ni la victoire enorgueiller.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Marie-Louise n&rsquo;est pas la femme de Napol&eacute;on; c&rsquo;est
la France que Napol&eacute;on a &eacute;pous&eacute;e; c&rsquo;est la
France qu&rsquo;il aime, leur union enfante la perte de l&rsquo;Europe;
voil&agrave; la divorce que je veux; voil&agrave; l&rsquo;union qu&rsquo;il
faut briser.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La voix des timides et des tra&icirc;tres protesta contre
cette sentence.&nbsp; &lsquo;C&rsquo;est abuser de droit de la victoire!&nbsp;
C&rsquo;est fouler aux pieds le vaincu!&nbsp; Que l&rsquo;Angleterre
se montre cl&eacute;mente, qu&rsquo;elle ouvre ses bras pour recevoir
comme h&ocirc;te son ennemi d&eacute;sarm&eacute;.&rsquo;&nbsp; L&rsquo;Angleterre
aurait peut-&ecirc;tre &eacute;cout&eacute; ce conseii, car partout
et toujours il y a des &acirc;mes faibles et timor&eacute;es bient&ocirc;t
s&eacute;duites par la flatterie ou effray&eacute;es par le reproche.&nbsp;
Mais la Providence permit qu&rsquo;un homme se trouv&acirc;t qui n&rsquo;a
jamais su ce que c&rsquo;est que la crainte; qui aima sa patrie mieux
que sa renomm&eacute;e; imp&eacute;n&eacute;trable devant les menaces,
inaccessible aux louanges, il se pr&eacute;senta devant le conseil de
la nation, et levant son front tranquille en haut, il osa dire: &lsquo;Que
la trahison se taise! car c&rsquo;est trahir que de conseiller de temporiser
avec Buonaparte.&nbsp; Moi je sais ce que sont ces guerres dont l&rsquo;Europe
saigne encore, comme une victime sous le couteau du boucher.&nbsp; Il
faut en finir avec Napol&eacute;on Buonaparte.&nbsp; Vous vous effrayez
&agrave; tort d&rsquo;un mot si dur!&nbsp; Je n&rsquo;ai pas de magnanimit&eacute;,
dit-on?&nbsp; Soit! que m&rsquo;importe ce qu&rsquo;on dit de moi?&nbsp;
Je n&rsquo;ai pas ici &agrave; me faire une r&eacute;putation de h&eacute;ros
magnanime, mais &agrave; gu&eacute;rir, si la cure est possible, l&rsquo;Europe
qui se meurt, &eacute;puis&eacute;e de ressources et de sang, l&rsquo;Europe
dont vous n&eacute;gligez les vrais int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts, pr&eacute;-occup&eacute;s
que vous &ecirc;tes d&rsquo;une vaine renomm&eacute;e de cl&eacute;mence.&nbsp;
Vous &ecirc;tes faibles!&nbsp; Eh bien! je viens vous aider.&nbsp; Envoyez
Buonaparte &agrave; Ste. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne! n&rsquo;h&eacute;sitez
pas, ne cherchez pas un autre endroit; c&rsquo;&eacute;st le seul convenable.&nbsp;
Je vous le dis, j&rsquo;ai r&eacute;fl&eacute;chi pour vous; c&rsquo;est
l&agrave; qu&rsquo;il doit &ecirc;tr&eacute; et non pas ailleurs.&nbsp;
Quant &agrave; Napol&eacute;on, homme, soldat, je n&rsquo;ai rien contre
lui; c&rsquo;est un lion royal, aupr&egrave;s de qui vous n&rsquo;&ecirc;tes
que des chacals.&nbsp; Mais Napol&eacute;on Empereur, c&rsquo;est autre
chose, je l&rsquo;extirperai du sol de l&rsquo;Europe.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Et celui qui parla ainsi toujours sut garder sa promesse, celle-l&agrave;
comme toutes les autres.&nbsp; Je l&rsquo;ai dit, et je le r&eacute;p&egrave;te,
cet homme est l&rsquo;&eacute;gal de Napol&eacute;on par le g&eacute;nie;
comme trempe de caract&egrave;re, comme droiture, comme &eacute;l&eacute;vation
de pens&eacute;e et de but, il est d&rsquo;une tout autre esp&egrave;ce.&nbsp;
Napol&eacute;on Buonaparte &eacute;tait avide de renomm&eacute;e et
de gloire; Arthur Wellesley ne se soucie ni de l&rsquo;une ni de l&rsquo;autre;
l&rsquo;opinion publique, la popularit&eacute;, &eacute;taient choses
de grand valeur aux yeux de Napol&eacute;on; pour Wellington l&rsquo;opinion
publique est une rumeur, un rien que le souffle de son inflexible volont&eacute;
fait dispara&icirc;tre comme une bulle de savon.&nbsp; Napol&eacute;on
flattait le peuple; Wellington le brusqne; l&rsquo;un cherchait les
applau-dissements, l&rsquo;autre ne se soucie que du t&eacute;moignage
de sa conscience; quand elle approuve, c&rsquo;est assez; toute autre
louange l&rsquo;obs&egrave;de.&nbsp; Aussi ce peuple, qui adorait Buonaparte
s&rsquo;irritait, s&rsquo;insurgeait contre la morgue de Wellington:
parfois il lui t&eacute;moigna sa col&egrave;re et sa haine par des
grognements, par des hurlements de b&ecirc;tes fauves; et alors, avec
une impassibilit&eacute; de s&eacute;nateur romain, le moderne Coriolan
toisait du regard l&rsquo;&eacute;meute furieuse; il croisait ses bras
nerveux sur sa large poitrine, et seul, debout sur son seuil, il attendait,
il bravait cette temp&ecirc;te populaire dont les flots venaient mourir
&agrave; quelques pas de lui: et quand la foule, honteuse de sa rebellion,
venait l&eacute;cher les pieds du ma&icirc;tre, le hautain patricien
m&eacute;prisait l&rsquo;hommage d&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui comme la
haine d&rsquo;hier, et dans les rues de Londres, et devant son palais
ducal d&rsquo;Apsley, il repoussait d&rsquo;un genre plein de froid
d&eacute;dain l&rsquo;incommode empressement du peuple enthousiaste.&nbsp;
Cette fiert&eacute; n&eacute;anmoins n&rsquo;excluait pas en lui une
rare modestie; partout il se soustrait &agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;loge;
se d&eacute;robe au pan&eacute;gyrique; jamais il ne parle de ses exploits,
et jamais il ne souffre qu&rsquo;un autre lui en parle en sa pr&eacute;sence.&nbsp;
Son caract&egrave;re &eacute;gale en grandeur et surpasse en v&eacute;rit&eacute;
celui de tout autre h&eacute;ros ancien ou moderne.&nbsp; La gloire
de Napol&eacute;on cr&ucirc;t en une nuit, comme la vigne de Jonas,
et il suffit d&rsquo;un jour pour la fl&eacute;trir; la gloire de Wellington
est comme les vieux ch&ecirc;nes qui ombragent le ch&acirc;teau de ses

<p>How often in writing this paper &ldquo;in a strange land,&rdquo;
must Miss Bront&euml; have thought of the old childish disputes in the
kitchen of Haworth parsonage, touching the respective merits of Wellington
and Buonaparte!&nbsp; Although the title given to her <i>devoir</i>
is, &ldquo;On the Death of Napoleon,&rdquo; she seems yet to have considered
it a point of honour rather to sing praises to an English hero than
to dwell on the character of a foreigner, placed as she was among those
who cared little either for an England or for Wellington.&nbsp; She
now felt that she had made great progress towards obtaining proficiency
in the French language, which had been her main object in coming to
Brussels.&nbsp; But to the zealous learner &ldquo;Alps on Alps arise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
No sooner is one difficulty surmounted than some other desirable attainment
appears, and must be laboured after.&nbsp; A knowledge of German now
became her object; and she resolved to compel herself to remain in Brussels
till that was gained.&nbsp; The strong yearning to go home came upon
her; the stronger self-denying will forbade.&nbsp; There was a great
internal struggle; every fibre of her heart quivered in the strain to
master her will; and, when she conquered herself, she remained, not
like a victor calm and supreme on the throne, but like a panting, torn,
and suffering victim.&nbsp; Her nerves and her spirits gave way.&nbsp;
Her health became much shaken.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brussels, August 1st, 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I complain in this letter, have mercy and don&rsquo;t blame
me, for, I forewarn you, I am in low spirits, and that earth and heaven
are dreary and empty to me at this moment.&nbsp; In a few days our vacation
will begin; everybody is joyous and animated at the prospect, because
everybody is to go home.&nbsp; I know that I am to stay here during
the five weeks that the holidays last, and that I shall be much alone
during that time, and consequently get downcast, and find both days
and nights of a weary length.&nbsp; It is the first time in my life
that I have really dreaded the vacation.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I can hardly
write, I have such a dreary weight at my heart; and I do so wish to
go home.&nbsp; Is not this childish?&nbsp; Pardon me, for I cannot help
it.&nbsp; However, though I am not strong enough to bear up cheerfully,
I can still bear up; and I will continue to stay (D. V.) some months
longer, till I have acquired German; and then I hope to see all your
faces again.&nbsp; Would that the vacation were well over! it will pass
so slowly.&nbsp; Do have the Christian charity to write me a long, long
letter; fill it with the minutest details; nothing will be uninteresting.&nbsp;
Do not think it is because people are unkind to me that I wish to leave
Belgium; nothing of the sort.&nbsp; Everybody is abundantly civil, but
home-sickness keeps creeping over me.&nbsp; I cannot shake it off.&nbsp;
Believe me, very merrily, vivaciously, gaily, yours,</p>
<p>&ldquo;C.B.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>grandes vacances</i> began soon after the date of this letter,
when she was left in the great deserted pensionnat, with only one teacher
for a companion.&nbsp; This teacher, a Frenchwoman, had always been
uncongenial to her; but, left to each other&rsquo;s sole companionship,
Charlotte soon discovered that her associate was more profligate, more
steeped in a kind of cold, systematic sensuality, than she had before
imagined it possible for a human being to be; and her whole nature revolted
from this woman&rsquo;s society.&nbsp; A low nervous fever was gaining
upon Miss Bront&euml;.&nbsp; She had never been a good sleeper, but
now she could not sleep at all.&nbsp; Whatever had been disagreeable,
or obnoxious, to her during the day, was presented when it was over
with exaggerated vividness to her disordered fancy.&nbsp; There were
causes for distress and anxiety in the news from home, particularly
as regarded Branwell.&nbsp; In the dead of the night, lying awake at
the end of the long deserted dormitory, in the vast and silent house,
every fear respecting those whom she loved, and who were so far off
in another country, became a terrible reality, oppressing her and choking
up the very life-blood in her heart.&nbsp; Those nights were times of
sick, dreary, wakeful misery; precursors of many such in after years.</p>
<p>In the daytime, driven abroad by loathing of her companion and by
the weak restlessness of fever, she tried to walk herself into such
a state of bodily fatigue as would induce sleep.&nbsp; So she went out,
and with weary steps would traverse the Boulevards and the streets,
sometimes for hours together; faltering and resting occasionally on
some of the many benches placed for the repose of happy groups, or for
solitary wanderers like herself.&nbsp; Then up again&mdash;anywhere
but to the pensionnat&mdash;out to the cemetery where Martha lay&mdash;out
beyond it, to the hills whence there is nothing to be seen but fields
as far as the horizon.&nbsp; The shades of evening made her retrace
her footsteps&mdash;sick for want of food, but not hungry; fatigued
with long continued exercise&mdash;yet restless still, and doomed to
another weary, haunted night of sleeplessness.&nbsp; She would thread
the streets in the neighbourhood of the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle, and yet
avoid it and its occupant, till as late an hour as she dared be out.&nbsp;
At last, she was compelled to keep her bed for some days, and this compulsory
rest did her good.&nbsp; She was weak, but less depressed in spirits
than she had been, when the school re-opened, and her positive practical
duties recommenced.</p>
<p>She writes thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October 13th, 1843</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary is getting on well, as she deserves to do.&nbsp; I often
hear from her.&nbsp; Her letters and yours are one of my few pleasures.&nbsp;
She urges me very much to leave Brussels and go to her; but, at present,
however tempted to take such a step, I should not feel justified in
doing so.&nbsp; To leave a certainty for a complete uncertainty, would
be to the last degree imprudent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that, Brussels
is indeed desolate to me now.&nbsp; Since the D.s left, I have had no
friend.&nbsp; I had, indeed, some very kind acquaintances in the family
of a Dr. ---, but they, too, are gone now.&nbsp; They left in the latter
part of August, and I am completely alone.&nbsp; I cannot count the
Belgians anything.&nbsp; It is a curious position to be so utterly solitary
in the midst of numbers.&nbsp; Sometimes the solitude oppresses me to
an excess.&nbsp; One day, lately, I felt as if I could bear it no longer,
and I went to Madame H&eacute;ger, and gave her notice.&nbsp; If it
had depended on her, I should certainly have soon been at liberty; but
M. H&eacute;ger, having heard of what was in agitation, sent for me
the day after, and pronounced with vehemence his decision, that I should
not leave.&nbsp; I could not, at that time, have persevered in my intention
without exciting him to anger; so I promised to stay a little while
longer.&nbsp; How long that will be, I do not know.&nbsp; I should not
like to return to England to do nothing.&nbsp; I am too old for that
now; but if I could hear of a favourable opportunity for commencing
a school, I think I should embrace it.&nbsp; We have as yet no fires
here, and I suffer much from cold; otherwise, I am well in health.&nbsp;
Mr. --- will take this letter to England.&nbsp; He is a pretty-looking
and pretty behaved young man, apparently constructed without a backbone;
by which I don&rsquo;t allude to his corporal spine, which is all right
enough, but to his character.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I get on here after a fashion; but now that Mary
D. has left Brussels, I have nobody to speak to, for I count the Belgians
as nothing.&nbsp; Sometimes I ask myself how long shall I stay here;
but as yet I have only asked the question; I have not answered it.&nbsp;
However, when I have acquired as much German as I think fit, I think
I shall pack up bag and baggage and depart.&nbsp; Twinges of home-sickness
cut me to the heart, every now and then.&nbsp; To-day the weather is
glaring, and I am stupified with a bad cold and headache.&nbsp; I have
nothing to tell you.&nbsp; One day is like another in this place.&nbsp;
I know you, living in the country, can hardly believe it is possible
life can be monotonous in the centre of a brilliant capital like Brussels;
but so it is.&nbsp; I feel it most on holidays, when all the girls and
teachers go out to visit, and it sometimes happens that I am left, during
several hours, quite alone, with four great desolate schoolrooms at
my disposition.&nbsp; I try to read, I try to write; but in vain.&nbsp;
I then wander about from room to room, but the silence and loneliness
of all the house weighs down one&rsquo;s spirits like lead.&nbsp; You
will hardly believe that Madame H&eacute;ger (good and kind as I have
described her) never comes near me on these occasions.&nbsp; I own,
I was astonished the first time I was left alone thus; when everybody
else was enjoying the pleasures of a f&ecirc;te day with their friends,
and she knew I was quite by myself, and never took the least notice
of me.&nbsp; Yet, I understand, she praises me very much to everybody,
and says what excellent lessons I give.&nbsp; She is not colder to me
than she is to the other teachers; but they are less dependent on her
than I am.&nbsp; They have relations and acquaintances in Bruxelles.&nbsp;
You remember the letter she wrote me, when I was in England?&nbsp; How
kind and affectionate that was? is it not odd?&nbsp; In the meantime,
the complaints I make at present are a sort of relief which I permit
myself.&nbsp; In all other respects I am well satisfied with my position,
and you may say so to people who inquire after me (if any one does).&nbsp;
Write to me, dear, whenever you can.&nbsp; You do a good deed when you
send me a letter, for you comfort a very desolate heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons for the silent estrangement between Madame H&eacute;ger
and Miss Bront&euml;, in the second year of her residence at Brussels,
is to be found in the fact, that the English Protestant&rsquo;s dislike
of Romanism increased with her knowledge of it, and its effects upon
those who professed it; and when occasion called for an expression of
opinion from Charlotte Bront&euml;, she was uncompromising truth.&nbsp;
Madame H&eacute;ger, on the opposite side, was not merely a Roman Catholic,
she was <i>d&eacute;vote</i>.&nbsp; Not of a warm or impulsive temperament,
she was naturally governed by her conscience, rather than by her affections;
and her conscience was in the hands of her religious guides.&nbsp; She
considered any slight thrown upon her Church as blasphemy against the
Holy Truth; and, though she was not given to open expression of her
thoughts and feelings, yet her increasing coolness of behaviour showed
how much her most cherished opinions had been wounded.&nbsp; Thus, although
there was never any explanation of Madame H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s change
of manner, this may be given as one great reason why, about this time,
Charlotte was made painfully conscious of a silent estrangement between
them; an estrangement of which, perhaps, the former was hardly aware.&nbsp;
I have before alluded to intelligence from home, calculated to distress
Charlotte exceedingly with fears respecting Branwell, which I shall
speak of more at large when the realisation of her worst apprehensions
came to affect the daily life of herself and her sisters.&nbsp; I allude
to the subject again here, in order that the reader may remember the
gnawing, private cares, which she had to bury in her own heart; and
the pain of which could only be smothered for a time under the diligent
fulfilment of present duty.&nbsp; Another dim sorrow was faintly perceived
at this time.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s eyesight began to fail; it was
not unlikely that he might shortly become blind; more of his duty must
devolve on a curate, and Mr. Bront&euml;, always liberal, would have
to pay at a higher rate than he had heretofore done for this assistance.</p>
<p>She wrote thus to Emily:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dec.1st, 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Sunday morning.&nbsp; They are at their idolatrous
&lsquo;messe,&rsquo; and I am here, that is in the Refectoire.&nbsp;
I should like uncommonly to be in the dining-room at home, or in the
kitchen, or in the back kitchen.&nbsp; I should like even to be cutting
up the hash, with the clerk and some register people at the other table,
and you standing by, watching that I put enough flour, not too much
pepper, and, above all, that I save the best pieces of the leg of mutton
for Tiger and Keeper, the first of which personages would be jumping
about the dish and carving-knife, and the latter standing like a devouring
flame on the kitchen-floor.&nbsp; To complete the picture, Tabby blowing
the fire, in order to boil the potatoes to a sort of vegetable glue!&nbsp;
How divine are these recollections to me at this moment!&nbsp; Yet I
have no thought of coming home just now.&nbsp; I lack a real pretext
for doing so; it is true this place is dismal to me, but I cannot go
home without a fixed prospect when I get there; and this prospect must
not be a situation; that would be jumping out of the frying-pan into
the fire.&nbsp; <i>You</i> call yourself idle! absurd, absurd! . . .
Is papa well?&nbsp; Are you well? and Tabby?&nbsp; You ask about Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s visit to Brussels.&nbsp; I saw her for an instant flashing
through the Rue Royale in a carriage and six, surrounded by soldiers.&nbsp;
She was laughing and talking very gaily.&nbsp; She looked a little stout,
vivacious lady, very plainly dressed, not much dignity or pretension
about her.&nbsp; The Belgians liked her very well on the whole.&nbsp;
They said she enlivened the sombre court of King Leopold, which is usually
as gloomy as a conventicle.&nbsp; Write to me again soon.&nbsp; Tell
me whether papa really wants me very much to come home, and whether
you do likewise.&nbsp; I have an idea that I should be of no use there&mdash;a
sort of aged person upon the parish.&nbsp; I pray, with heart and soul,
that all may continue well at Haworth; above all in our grey half-inhabited
house.&nbsp; God bless the walls thereof!&nbsp; Safety, health, happiness,
and prosperity to you, papa, and Tabby.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C. B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the end of this year (1843) various reasons conspired with
the causes of anxiety which have been mentioned, to make her feel that
her presence was absolutely and imperatively required at home, while
she had acquired all that she proposed to herself in coming to Brussels
the second time; and was, moreover, no longer regarded with the former
kindliness of feeling by Madame H&eacute;ger.&nbsp; In consequence of
this state of things, working down with sharp edge into a sensitive
mind, she suddenly announced to that lady her immediate intention of
returning to England.&nbsp; Both M. and Madame H&eacute;ger agreed that
it would be for the best, when they learnt only that part of the case
which she could reveal to them&mdash;namely, Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
increasing blindness.&nbsp; But as the inevitable moment of separation
from people and places, among which she had spent so many happy hours,
drew near, her spirits gave way; she had the natural presentiment that
she saw them all for the last time, and she received but a dead kind
of comfort from being reminded by her friends that Brussels and Haworth
were not so very far apart; that access from one place to the other
was not so difficult or impracticable as her tears would seem to predicate;
nay, there was some talk of one of Madame H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s daughters
being sent to her as a pupil, if she fulfilled her intention of trying
to begin a school.&nbsp; To facilitate her success in this plan, should
she ever engage in it, M. H&eacute;ger gave her a kind of diploma, dated
from, and sealed with the seal of the Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e Royal de
Bruxelles, certifying that she was perfectly capable of teaching the
French language, having well studied the grammar and composition thereof,
and, moreover, having prepared herself for teaching by studying and
practising the best methods of instruction.&nbsp; This certificate is
dated December 29th 1843, and on the 2nd of January, 1844, she arrived
at Haworth.</p>
<p>On the 23rd of the month she writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one asks me what I am going to do, now that I am returned
home; and every one seems to expect that I should immediately commence
a school.&nbsp; In truth, it is what I should wish to do.&nbsp; I desire
it above all things.&nbsp; I have sufficient money for the undertaking,
and I hope now sufficient qualifications to give me a fair chance of
success; yet I cannot yet permit myself to enter upon life&mdash;to
touch the object which seems now within my reach, and which I have been
so long straining to attain.&nbsp; You will ask me why?&nbsp; It is
on papa&rsquo;s account; he is now, as you know, getting old, and it
grieves me to tell you that he is losing his sight.&nbsp; I have felt
for some months that I ought not to be away from him; and I feel now
that it would be too selfish to leave him (at least, as long as Branwell
and Anne are absent), in order to pursue selfish interests of my own.&nbsp;
With the help of God, I will try to deny myself in this matter, and
to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suffered much before I left Brussels.&nbsp; I think, however
long I live, I shall not forget what the parting with M. H&eacute;ger
cost me.&nbsp; It grieved me so much to grieve him who has been so true,
kind, and disinterested a friend.&nbsp; At parting he gave me a kind
of diploma certifying my abilities as a teacher, sealed with the seal
of the Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e Royal, of which he is professor.&nbsp;
I was surprised also at the degree of regret expressed by my Belgian
pupils, when they knew I was going to leave.&nbsp; I did not think it
had been in their phlegmatic nature . . . I do not know whether you
feel as I do, but there are times now when it appears to me as if all
my ideas and feelings, except a few friendships and affections, are
changed from what they used to be; something in me, which used to be
enthusiasm, is tamed down and broken.&nbsp; I have fewer illusions;
what I wish for now is active exertion&mdash;a stake in life.&nbsp;
Haworth seems such a lonely, quiet spot, buried away from the world.&nbsp;
I no longer regard myself as young&mdash;indeed, I shall soon be twenty-eight;
and it seems as if I ought to be working and braving the rough realities
of the world, as other people do.&nbsp; It is, however, my duty to restrain
this feeling at present, and I will endeavour to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course her absent sister and brother obtained a holiday to welcome
her return home, and in a few weeks she was spared to pay a visit to
her friend at B.&nbsp; But she was far from well or strong, and the
short journey of fourteen miles seems to have fatigued her greatly.</p>
<p>Soon after she came back to Haworth, in a letter to one of the household
in which she had been staying, there occurs this passage:&mdash;&ldquo;Our
poor little cat has been ill two days, and is just dead.&nbsp; It is
piteous to see even an animal lying lifeless.&nbsp; Emily is sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These few words relate to points in the characters of the two sisters,
which I must dwell upon a little.&nbsp; Charlotte was more than commonly
tender in her treatment of all dumb creatures, and they, with that fine
instinct so often noticed, were invariably attracted towards her.&nbsp;
The deep and exaggerated consciousness of her personal defects&mdash;the
constitutional absence of hope, which made her slow to trust in human
affection, and, consequently, slow to respond to any manifestation of
it&mdash;made her manner shy and constrained to men and women, and even
to children.&nbsp; We have seen something of this trembling distrust
of her own capability of inspiring affection, in the grateful surprise
she expresses at the regret felt by her Belgian pupils at her departure.&nbsp;
But not merely were her actions kind, her words and tones were ever
gentle and caressing, towards animals: and she quickly noticed the least
want of care or tenderness on the part of others towards any poor brute
creature.&nbsp; The readers of &ldquo;Shirley&rdquo; may remember that
it is one of the tests which the heroine applies to her lover.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do you know what soothsayers I would consult?&rdquo;
. . . &ldquo;The little Irish beggar that comes barefoot to my door;
the mouse that steals out of the cranny in my wainscot; the bird in
frost and snow that pecks at my window for a crumb; the dog that licks
my hand and sits beside my knee.&nbsp; I know somebody to whose knee
the black cat loves to climb, against whose shoulder and cheek it likes
to purr.&nbsp; The old dog always comes out of his kennel and wags his
tail, and whines affectionately when somebody passes.&rdquo;&nbsp; [For
&ldquo;somebody&rdquo; and &ldquo;he,&rdquo; read &ldquo;Charlotte Bront&euml;&rdquo;
and &ldquo;she.&rdquo;]&nbsp; &ldquo;He quietly strokes the cat, and
lets her sit while he conveniently can; and when he must disturb her
by rising, he puts her softly down, and never flings her from him roughly:
he always whistles to the dog, and gives him a caress.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feeling, which in Charlotte partook of something of the nature
of an affection, was, with Emily, more of a passion.&nbsp; Some one
speaking of her to me, in a careless kind of strength of expression,
said, &ldquo;she never showed regard to any human creature; all her
love was reserved for animals.&rdquo;&nbsp; The helplessness of an animal
was its passport to Charlotte&rsquo;s heart; the fierce, wild, intractability
of its nature was what often recommended it to Emily.&nbsp; Speaking
of her dead sister, the former told me that from her many traits in
Shirley&rsquo;s character were taken; her way of sitting on the rug
reading, with her arm round her rough bull-dog&rsquo;s neck; her calling
to a strange dog, running past, with hanging head and lolling tongue,
to give it a merciful draught of water, its maddened snap at her, her
nobly stern presence of mind, going right into the kitchen, and taking
up one of Tabby&rsquo;s red-hot Italian irons to sear the bitten place,
and telling no one, till the danger was well-nigh over, for fear of
the terrors that might beset their weaker minds.&nbsp; All this, looked
upon as a well-invented fiction in &ldquo;Shirley,&rdquo; was written
down by Charlotte with streaming eyes; it was the literal true account
of what Emily had done.&nbsp; The same tawny bull-dog (with his &ldquo;strangled
whistle&rdquo;), called &ldquo;Tartar&rdquo; in &ldquo;Shirley,&rdquo;
was &ldquo;Keeper&rdquo; in Haworth parsonage; a gift to Emily.&nbsp;
With the gift came a warning.&nbsp; Keeper was faithful to the depths
of his nature as long as he was with friends; but he who struck him
with a stick or whip, roused the relentless nature of the brute, who
flew at his throat forthwith, and held him there till one or the other
was at the point of death.&nbsp; Now Keeper&rsquo;s household fault
was this.&nbsp; He loved to steal upstairs, and stretch his square,
tawny limbs, on the comfortable beds, covered over with delicate white
counterpanes.&nbsp; But the cleanliness of the parsonage arrangements
was perfect; and this habit of Keeper&rsquo;s was so objectionable,
that Emily, in reply to Tabby&rsquo;s remonstrances, declared that,
if he was found again transgressing, she herself, in defiance of warning
and his well-known ferocity of nature, would beat him so severely that
he would never offend again.&nbsp; In the gathering dusk of an autumn
evening, Tabby came, half-triumphantly, half-tremblingly, but in great
wrath, to tell Emily that Keeper was lying on the best bed, in drowsy
voluptuousness.&nbsp; Charlotte saw Emily&rsquo;s whitening face, and
set mouth, but dared not speak to interfere; no one dared when Emily&rsquo;s
eyes glowed in that manner out of the paleness of her face, and when
her lips were so compressed into stone.&nbsp; She went upstairs, and
Tabby and Charlotte stood in the gloomy passage below, full of the dark
shadows of coming night.&nbsp; Down-stairs came Emily, dragging after
her the unwilling Keeper, his hind legs set in a heavy attitude of resistance,
held by the &ldquo;scuft of his neck,&rdquo; but growling low and savagely
all the time.&nbsp; The watchers would fain have spoken, but durst not,
for fear of taking off Emily&rsquo;s attention, and causing her to avert
her head for a moment from the enraged brute.&nbsp; She let him go,
planted in a dark corner at the bottom of the stairs; no time was there
to fetch stick or rod, for fear of the strangling clutch at her throat&mdash;her
bare clenched fist struck against his red fierce eyes, before he had
time to make his spring, and, in the language of the turf, she &ldquo;punished
him&rdquo; till his eyes were swelled up, and the half-blind, stupified
beast was led to his accustomed lair, to have his swollen head fomented
and cared for by the very Emily herself.&nbsp; The generous dog owed
her no grudge; he loved her dearly ever after; he walked first among
the mourners to her funeral; he slept moaning for nights at the door
of her empty room, and never, so to speak, rejoiced, dog fashion, after
her death.&nbsp; He, in his turn, was mourned over by the surviving
sister.&nbsp; Let us somehow hope, in half Red Indian creed, that he
follows Emily now; and, when he rests, sleeps on some soft white bed
of dreams, unpunished when he awakens to the life of the land of shadows.</p>
<p>Now we can understand the force of the words, &ldquo;Our poor little
cat is dead.&nbsp; Emily is sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>The moors were a great resource this spring; Emily and Charlotte
walked out on them perpetually, &ldquo;to the great damage of our shoes,
but I hope, to the benefit of our health.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old plan
of school-keeping was often discussed in these rambles; but in-doors
they set with vigour to shirt-making for the absent Branwell, and pondered
in silence over their past and future life.&nbsp; At last they came
to a determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seriously entered into the enterprise of keeping a
school&mdash;or rather, taking a limited number of pupils at home.&nbsp;
That is, I have begun in good earnest to seek for pupils.&nbsp; I wrote
to Mrs. --- &rdquo; (the lady with whom she had lived as governess,
just before going to Brussels), &ldquo;not asking her for her daughter&mdash;I
cannot do that&mdash;but informing her of my intention.&nbsp; I received
an answer from Mr. --- expressive of, I believe, sincere regret that
I had not informed them a month sooner, in which case, he said, they
would gladly have sent me their own daughter, and also Colonel S.&rsquo;s,
but that now both were promised to Miss C.&nbsp; I was partly disappointed
by this answer, and partly gratified; indeed, I derived quite an impulse
of encouragement from the warm assurance that if I had but applied a
little sooner they would certainly have sent me their daughter.&nbsp;
I own I had misgivings that nobody would be willing to send a child
for education to Haworth.&nbsp; These misgivings are partly done away
with.&nbsp; I have written also to Mrs. B., and have enclosed the diploma
which M. H&eacute;ger gave me before I left Brussels.&nbsp; I have not
yet received her answer, but I wait for it with some anxiety.&nbsp;
I do not expect that she will send me any of her children, but if she
would, I dare say she could recommend me other pupils.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
she knows us only very slightly.&nbsp; As soon as I can get an assurance
of only <i>one</i> pupil, I will have cards of terms printed, and will
commence the repairs necessary in the house.&nbsp; I wish all that to
be done before winter.&nbsp; I think of fixing the board and English
education at 25<i>l</i>. per annum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, at a later date, July 24th, in the same year, she writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am driving on with my small matter as well as I can.&nbsp;
I have written to all the friends on whom I have the slightest claim,
and to some on whom I have no claim; Mrs. B., for example.&nbsp; On
her, also, I have actually made bold to call.&nbsp; She was exceedingly
polite; regretted that her children were already at school at Liverpool;
thought the undertaking a most praiseworthy one, but feared I should
have some difficulty in making it succeed on account of the <i>situation</i>.&nbsp;
Such is the answer I receive from almost every one.&nbsp; I tell them
the <i>retired situation</i> is, in some points of view, an advantage;
that were it in the midst of a large town I could not pretend to take
pupils on terms so moderate (Mrs. B. remarked that she thought the terms
very moderate), but that, as it is, not having house-rent to pay, we
can offer the same privileges of education that are to be had in expensive
seminaries, at little more than half their price; and as our number
must be limited, we can devote a large share of time and pains to each
pupil.&nbsp; Thank you for the very pretty little purse you have sent
me.&nbsp; I make to you a curious return in the shape of half a dozen
cards of terms.&nbsp; Make such use of them as your judgment shall dictate.&nbsp;
You will see that I have fixed the sum at 35<i>l</i>., which I think
is the just medium, considering advantages and disadvantages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was written in July; August, September, and October passed away,
and no pupils were to be heard of.&nbsp; Day after day, there was a
little hope felt by the sisters until the post came in.&nbsp; But Haworth
village was wild and lonely, and the Bront&euml;s but little known,
owing to their want of connections.&nbsp; Charlotte writes on the subject,
in the early winter months, to this effect&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I, Emily, and Anne, are truly obliged to you for
the efforts you have made in our behalf; and if you have not been successful,
you are only like ourselves.&nbsp; Every one wishes us well; but there
are no pupils to be had.&nbsp; We have no present intention, however,
of breaking our hearts on the subject, still less of feeling mortified
at defeat.&nbsp; The effort must be beneficial, whatever the result
may be, because it teaches us experience, and an additional knowledge
of this world.&nbsp; I send you two more circulars.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A month later, she says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have made no alterations yet in our house.&nbsp;
It would be folly to do so, while there is so little likelihood of our
ever getting pupils.&nbsp; I fear you are giving yourself too much trouble
on our account.&nbsp; Depend upon it, if you were to persuade a mamma
to bring her child to Haworth, the aspect of the place would frighten
her, and she would probably take the dear girl back with her, instanter.&nbsp;
We are glad that we have made the attempt, and we will not be cast down
because it has not succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were, probably, growing up in each sister&rsquo;s heart, secret
unacknowledged feelings of relief, that their plan had not succeeded.&nbsp;
Yes! a dull sense of relief that their cherished project had been tried
and had failed.&nbsp; For that house, which was to be regarded as an
occasional home for their brother, could hardly be a fitting residence
for the children of strangers.&nbsp; They had, in all likelihood, become
silently aware that his habits were such as to render his society at
times most undesirable.&nbsp; Possibly, too, they had, by this time,
heard distressing rumours concerning the cause of that remorse and agony
of mind, which at times made him restless and unnaturally merry, at
times rendered him moody and irritable.</p>
<p>In January, 1845, Charlotte says:&mdash;&ldquo;Branwell has been
quieter and less irritable, on the whole, this time than he was in summer.&nbsp;
Anne is, as usual, always good, mild, and patient.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
deep-seated pain which he was to occasion to his relations had now taken
a decided form, and pressed heavily on Charlotte&rsquo;s health and
spirits.&nbsp; Early in this year, she went to H. to bid good-bye to
her dear friend &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; who was leaving England for Australia.</p>
<p>Branwell, I have mentioned, had obtained the situation of a private
tutor.&nbsp; Anne was also engaged as governess in the same family,
and was thus a miserable witness to her brother&rsquo;s deterioration
of character at this period.&nbsp; Of the causes of this deterioration
I cannot speak; but the consequences were these.&nbsp; He went home
for his holidays reluctantly, stayed there as short a time as possible,
perplexing and distressing them all by his extraordinary conduct&mdash;at
one time in the highest spirits, at another, in the deepest depression&mdash;accusing
himself of blackest guilt and treachery, without specifying what they
were; and altogether evincing an irritability of disposition bordering
on insanity.</p>
<p>Charlotte and Emily suffered acutely from his mysterious behaviour.&nbsp;
He expressed himself more than satisfied with his situation; he was
remaining in it for a longer time than he had ever done in any kind
of employment before; so that for some time they could not conjecture
that anything there made him so wilful, and restless, and full of both
levity and misery.&nbsp; But a sense of something wrong connected with
him, sickened and oppressed them.&nbsp; They began to lose all hope
in his future career.&nbsp; He was no longer the family pride; an indistinct
dread, caused partly by his own conduct, partly by expressions of agonising
suspicion in Anne&rsquo;s letters home, was creeping over their minds
that he might turn out their deep disgrace.&nbsp; But, I believe, they
shrank from any attempt to define their fears, and spoke of him to each
other as little as possible.&nbsp; They could not help but think, and
mourn, and wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feb. 20th, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent a week at H., not very pleasantly; headache, sickliness,
and flatness of spirits, made me a poor companion, a sad drag on the
vivacious and loquacious gaiety of all the other inmates of the house.&nbsp;
I never was fortunate enough to be able to rally, for as much as a single
hour, while I was there.&nbsp; I am sure all, with the exception perhaps
of Mary, were very glad when I took my departure.&nbsp; I begin to perceive
that I have too little life in me, now-a-days, to be fit company for
any except very quiet people.&nbsp; Is it age, or what else, that changes
me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! she hardly needed to have asked this question.&nbsp; How could
she be otherwise than &ldquo;flat-spirited,&rdquo; &ldquo;a poor companion,&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;sad drag&rdquo; on the gaiety of those who were light-hearted
and happy!&nbsp; Her honest plan for earning her own livelihood had
fallen away, crumbled to ashes; after all her preparations, not a pupil
had offered herself; and, instead of being sorry that this wish of many
years could not be realised, she had reason to be glad.&nbsp; Her poor
father, nearly sightless, depended upon her cares in his blind helplessness;
but this was a sacred pious charge, the duties of which she was blessed
in fulfilling.&nbsp; The black gloom hung over what had once been the
brightest hope of the family&mdash;over Branwell, and the mystery in
which his wayward conduct was enveloped.&nbsp; Somehow and sometime,
he would have to turn to his home as a hiding place for shame; such
was the sad foreboding of his sisters.&nbsp; Then how could she be cheerful,
when she was losing her dear and noble &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; for such
a length of time and distance of space that her heart might well prophesy
that it was &ldquo;for ever&rdquo;?&nbsp; Long before, she had written
of Mary T., that she &ldquo;was full of feelings noble, warm, generous,
devoted, and profound.&nbsp; God bless her!&nbsp; I never hope to see
in this world a character more truly noble.&nbsp; She would die willingly
for one she loved.&nbsp; Her intellect and attainments are of the very
highest standard.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this was the friend whom she was
to lose!&nbsp; Hear that friend&rsquo;s account of their final interview:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I last saw Charlotte (Jan. 1845), she told me she had
quite decided to stay at home.&nbsp; She owned she did not like it.&nbsp;
Her health was weak.&nbsp; She said she should like any change at first,
as she had liked Brussels at first, and she thought that there must
be some possibility for some people of having a life of more variety
and more communion with human kind, but she saw none for her.&nbsp;
I told her very warmly, that she ought not to stay at home; that to
spend the next five years at home, in solitude and weak health, would
ruin her; that she would never recover it.&nbsp; Such a dark shadow
came over her face when I said, &lsquo;Think of what you&rsquo;ll be
five years hence!&rsquo; that I stopped, and said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
cry, Charlotte!&rsquo;&nbsp; She did not cry, but went on walking up
and down the room, and said in a little while, &lsquo;But I intend to
stay, Polly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few weeks after she parted from Mary, she gives this account of
her days at Haworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;March 24th, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly tell you how time gets on at Haworth.&nbsp; There
is no event whatever to mark its progress.&nbsp; One day resembles another;
and all have heavy, lifeless physiognomies.&nbsp; Sunday, baking-day,
and Saturday, are the only ones that have any distinctive mark.&nbsp;
Meantime, life wears away.&nbsp; I shall soon be thirty; and I have
done nothing yet.&nbsp; Sometimes I get melancholy at the prospect before
and behind me.&nbsp; Yet it is wrong and foolish to repine.&nbsp; Undoubtedly,
my duty directs me to stay at home for the present.&nbsp; There was
a time when Haworth was a very pleasant place to me; it is not so now.&nbsp;
I feel as if we were all buried here.&nbsp; I long to travel; to work;
to live a life of action.&nbsp; Excuse me, dear, for troubling you with
my fruitless wishes.&nbsp; I will put by the rest, and not trouble you
with them.&nbsp; You must write to me.&nbsp; If you knew how welcome
your letters are, you would write very often.&nbsp; Your letters, and
the French newspapers, are the only messengers that come to me from
the outer world beyond our moors; and very welcome messengers they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of her daily employments was to read to her father, and it required
a little gentle diplomacy on her part to effect this duty; for there
were times when the offer of another to do what he had been so long
accustomed to do for himself, only reminded him too painfully of the
deprivation under which he was suffering.&nbsp; And, in secret, she,
too, dreaded a similar loss for herself.&nbsp; Long-continued ill health,
a deranged condition of the liver, her close application to minute drawing
and writing in her younger days, her now habitual sleeplessness at nights,
the many bitter noiseless tears she had shed over Branwell&rsquo;s mysterious
and distressing conduct&mdash;all these causes were telling on her poor
eyes; and about this time she thus writes to M. H&eacute;ger:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a rien que je crains comme le d&eacute;soeuvrement,
l&rsquo;inertie, la l&eacute;thargie des facult&eacute;s.&nbsp; Quand
le corps est paresseux l&rsquo;esprit souffre cruellement; je ne conna&icirc;trais
pas cette l&eacute;thargie, si je pouvais &eacute;crire.&nbsp; Autrefois
je passais des journ&eacute;es, des semaines, des mois entiers &agrave;
&eacute;crire, et pas tout-&agrave;-fait sans fruit, puisque Southey
et Coleridge, deux de nos meilleurs auteurs, &agrave; qui j&rsquo;ai
envoy&eacute; certains manuscrits, en ont bien voulu t&eacute;moigner
leur approbation; mais &agrave; pr&eacute;sent, j&rsquo;ai la vue trop
faible; si j&rsquo;&eacute;crivais beaueoup je deviendrais aveugle.&nbsp;
Cette faiblesse de vue est pour moi une terrible privation; sans cela,
savez-vous ce que je ferais, Monsieur?&nbsp; J&rsquo;&eacute;crirais
un livre et je le d&eacute;dierais &agrave; mon ma&icirc;tre de litt&eacute;rature,
au seul ma&icirc;tre que j&rsquo;aie jamais eu&mdash;&agrave; vous,
Monsieur!&nbsp; Je vous ai dit souvent en fran&ccedil;ais combien je
vous respecte, combien je suis redevable &agrave; votre bont&eacute;,
&agrave; vos conseils.&nbsp; Je voudrais le dire une fois en anglais.&nbsp;
Cela ne se peut pas; il ne faut pas y penser.&nbsp; La carri&egrave;re
des lettres m&rsquo;est ferm&eacute;e . . . N&rsquo;oubliez pas de me
dire comment vous vous portez, comment Madame et les enfants se portent.&nbsp;
Je compte bient&ocirc;t avoir de vos nouvelles; cette id&eacute;e me
souris, car le souvenir de vos bont&eacute;s ne s&rsquo;effacera jamais
de ma m&eacute;moire, et tant que ce souvenir durera, le respect que
vous m&rsquo;avez inspir&eacute; durera aussi.&nbsp; Agr&eacute;ez,
Monsieur,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is probable, that even her sisters and most intimate friends did
not know of this dread of ultimate blindness which beset her at this
period.&nbsp; What eyesight she had to spare she reserved for the use
of her father.&nbsp; She did but little plain-sewing; not more writing
than could be avoided, and employed herself principally in knitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;April 2nd, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see plainly it is proved to us that there is scarcely a
draught of unmingled happiness to be had in this world.&nbsp; ---&rsquo;s
illness comes with ---&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp; Mary T. finds herself
free, and on that path to adventure and exertion to which she has so
long been seeking admission.&nbsp; Sickness, hardship, danger are her
fellow travellers&mdash;her inseparable companions.&nbsp; She may have
been out of the reach of these S. W. N. W. gales, before they began
to blow, or they may have spent their fury on land, and not ruffled
the sea much.&nbsp; If it has been otherwise, she has been sorely tossed,
while we have been sleeping in our beds, or lying awake thinking about
her.&nbsp; Yet these real, material dangers, when once past, leave in
the mind the satisfaction of having struggled with difficulty, and overcome
it.&nbsp; Strength, courage, and experience are their invariable results;
whereas, I doubt whether suffering purely mental has any good result,
unless it be to make us by comparison less sensitive to physical suffering
. . . Ten years ago, I should have laughed at your account of the blunder
you made in mistaking the bachelor doctor for a married man.&nbsp; I
should have certainly thought you scrupulous over-much, and wondered
how you could possibly regret being civil to a decent individual, merely
because he happened to be single, instead of double.&nbsp; Now, however,
I can perceive that your scruples are founded on common sense.&nbsp;
I know that if women wish to escape the stigma of husband-seeking, they
must act and look like marble or clay&mdash;cold, expressionless, bloodless;
for every appearance of feeling, of joy, sorrow, friendliness, antipathy,
admiration, disgust, are alike construed by the world into the attempt
to hook a husband.&nbsp; Never mind! well-meaning women have their own
consciences to comfort them after all.&nbsp; Do not, therefore, be too
much afraid of showing yourself as you are, affectionate and good-hearted;
do not too harshly repress sentiments and feelings excellent in themselves,
because you fear that some puppy may fancy that you are letting them
come out to fascinate him; do not condemn yourself to live only by halves,
because if you showed too much animation some pragmatical thing in breeches
might take it into his pate to imagine that you designed to dedicate
your life to his inanity.&nbsp; Still, a composed, decent, equable deportment
is a capital treasure to a woman, and that you possess.&nbsp; Write
again soon, for I feel rather fierce, and want stroking down.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 13th, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the Mrs. ---, who, you say, is like me, I somehow feel
no leaning to her at all.&nbsp; I never do to people who are said to
be like me, because I have always a notion that they are only like me
in the disagreeable, outside, first-acquaintance part of my character;
in those points which are obvious to the ordinary run of people, and
which I know are not pleasing.&nbsp; You say she is &lsquo;clever&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;a
clever person.&rsquo;&nbsp; How I dislike the term!&nbsp; It means rather
a shrewd, very ugly, meddling, talking woman . . . I feel reluctant
to leave papa for a single day.&nbsp; His sight diminishes weekly; and
can it be wondered at that, as he sees the most precious of his faculties
leaving him, his spirits sometimes sink?&nbsp; It is so hard to feel
that his few and scanty pleasures must all soon go.&nbsp; He has now
the greatest difficulty in either reading or writing; and then he dreads
the state of dependence to which blindness will inevitably reduce him.&nbsp;
He fears that he will be nothing in his parish.&nbsp; I try to cheer
him; sometimes I succeed temporarily, but no consolation can restore
his sight, or atone for the want of it.&nbsp; Still he is never peevish;
never impatient; only anxious and dejected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the reason just given, Charlotte declined an invitation to the
only house to which she was now ever asked to come.&nbsp; In answer
to her correspondent&rsquo;s reply to this letter, she says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You thought I refused you coldly, did you?&nbsp;
It was a queer sort of coldness, when I would have given my ears to
say Yes, and was obliged to say No.&nbsp; Matters, however, are now
a little changed.&nbsp; Anne is come home, and her presence certainly
makes me feel more at liberty.&nbsp; Then, if all be well, I will come
and see you.&nbsp; Tell me only when I must come.&nbsp; Mention the
week and the day.&nbsp; Have the kindness also to answer the following
queries, if you can.&nbsp; How far is it from Leeds to Sheffield?&nbsp;
Can you give me a notion of the cost?&nbsp; Of course, when I come,
you will let me enjoy your own company in peace, and not drag me out
a visiting.&nbsp; I have no desire at all to see your curate.&nbsp;
I think he must be like all the other curates I have seen; and they
seem to me a self-seeking, vain, empty race.&nbsp; At this blessed moment,
we have no less than three of them in Haworth parish&mdash;and there
is not one to mend another.&nbsp; The other day, they all three, accompanied
by Mr. S., dropped, or rather rushed, in unexpectedly to tea.&nbsp;
It was Monday (baking day), and I was hot and tired; still, if they
had behaved quietly and decently, I would have served them out their
tea in peace; but they began glorifying themselves, and abusing Dissenters
in such a manner, that my temper lost its balance, and I pronounced
a few sentences sharply and rapidly, which struck them all dumb.&nbsp;
Papa was greatly horrified also, but I don&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On her return from this short visit to her friend, she travelled
with a gentleman in the railway carriage, whose features and bearing
betrayed him, in a moment, to be a Frenchman.&nbsp; She ventured to
ask him if such was not the case; and, on his admitting it, she further
inquired if he had not passed a considerable time in Germany, and was
answered that he had; her quick ear detected something of the thick
guttural pronunciation, which, Frenchmen say, they are able to discover
even in the grandchildren of their countrymen who have lived any time
beyond the Rhine.&nbsp; Charlotte had retained her skill in the language
by the habit of which she thus speaks to M. H&eacute;ger:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Je crains beaucoup d&rsquo;oublier le fran&ccedil;ais&mdash;j&rsquo;apprends
tous les jours une demie page de fran&ccedil;ais par coeur, et j&rsquo;ai
grand plaisir &agrave; apprendre cette le&ccedil;on, Veuillez presenter
&agrave; Madame l&rsquo;assurance de mon estime; je crains que Maria-Louise
et Claire ne m&rsquo;aient d&eacute;j&agrave; oubli&eacute;es; mais
je vous reverrai un jour; aussit&ocirc;t que j&rsquo;aurais gagn&eacute;
assez d&rsquo;argent pour alter &agrave; Bruxelles, j&rsquo;y irai.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so her journey back to Haworth, after the rare pleasure of this
visit to her friend, was pleasantly beguiled by conversation with the
French gentleman; and she arrived at home refreshed and happy.&nbsp;
What to find there?</p>
<p>It was ten o&rsquo;clock when she reached the parsonage.&nbsp; Branwell
was there, unexpectedly, very ill.&nbsp; He had come home a day or two
before, apparently for a holiday; in reality, I imagine, because some
discovery had been made which rendered his absence imperatively desirable.&nbsp;
The day of Charlotte&rsquo;s return, he had received a letter from Mr.
---, sternly dismissing him, intimating that his proceedings were discovered,
characterising them as bad beyond expression, and charging him, on pain
of exposure, to break off immediately, and for ever, all communication
with every member of the family.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the nature and depth of Branwell&rsquo;s sins,&mdash;whatever
may have been his temptation, whatever his guilt,&mdash;there is no
doubt of the suffering which his conduct entailed upon his poor father
and his innocent sisters.&nbsp; The hopes and plans they had cherished
long, and laboured hard to fulfil, were cruelly frustrated; henceforward
their days were embittered and the natural rest of their nights destroyed
by his paroxysms of remorse.&nbsp; Let us read of the misery caused
to his poor sisters in Charlotte&rsquo;s own affecting words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have had sad work with Branwell.&nbsp; He thought
of nothing but stunning or drowning his agony of mind.&nbsp; No one
in this house could have rest; and, at last, we have been obliged to
send him from home for a week, with some one to look after him.&nbsp;
He has written to me this morning, expressing some sense of contrition
. . . but as long as he remains at home, I scarce dare hope for peace
in the house.&nbsp; We must all, I fear, prepare for a season of distress
and disquietude.&nbsp; When I left you, I was strongly impressed with
the feeling that I was going back to sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;August, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things here at home are much as usual; not very bright as
it regards Branwell, though his health, and consequently his temper,
have been somewhat better this last day or two, because he is now <i>forced
to</i> abstain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;August 18th, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have delayed writing, because I have no good news to communicate.&nbsp;
My hopes ebb low indeed about Branwell.&nbsp; I sometimes fear he will
never be fit for much.&nbsp; The late blow to his prospects and feelings
has quite made him reckless.&nbsp; It is only absolute want of means
that acts as any check to him.&nbsp; One ought, indeed, to hope to the
very last; and I try to do so, but occasionally hope in his case seems
so fallacious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nov. 4th, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped to be able to ask you to come to Haworth.&nbsp; It
almost seemed as if Branwell had a chance of getting employment, and
I waited to know the result of his efforts in order to say, dear ---,
come and see us.&nbsp; But the place (a secretaryship to a railway committee)
is given to another person.&nbsp; Branwell still remains at home; and
while <i>he</i> is here, <i>you</i> shall not come.&nbsp; I am more
confirmed in that resolution the more I see of him.&nbsp; I wish I could
say one word to you in his favour, but I cannot.&nbsp; I will hold my
tongue.&nbsp; We are all obliged to you for your kind suggestion about
Leeds; but I think our school schemes are, for the present, at rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dec. 31st, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say well, in speaking of ---, that no sufferings are so
awful as those brought on by dissipation; alas! I see the truth of this
observation daily proved. &mdash;and&mdash;must have as weary and burdensome
a life of it in waiting upon their unhappy brother.&nbsp; It seems grievous,
indeed, that those who have not sinned should suffer so largely.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, all their latter days blighted with the presence of cruel,
shameful suffering,&mdash;the premature deaths of two at least of the
sisters,&mdash;all the great possibilities of their earthly lives snapped
short,&mdash;may be dated from Midsummer 1845.</p>
<p>For the last three years of Branwell&rsquo;s life, he took opium
habitually, by way of stunning conscience; he drank moreover, whenever
he could get the opportunity.&nbsp; The reader may say that I have mentioned
his tendency to intemperance long before.&nbsp; It is true; but it did
not become habitual, as far as I can learn, until after he was dismissed
from his tutorship.&nbsp; He took opium, because it made him forget
for a time more effectually than drink; and, besides, it was more portable.&nbsp;
In procuring it he showed all the cunning of the opium-eater.&nbsp;
He would steal out while the family were at church&mdash;to which he
had professed himself too ill to go&mdash;and manage to cajole the village
druggist out of a lump; or, it might be, the carrier had unsuspiciously
brought him some in a packet from a distance.&nbsp; For some time before
his death he had attacks of delirium tremens of the most frightful character;
he slept in his father&rsquo;s room, and he would sometimes declare
that either he or his father should be dead before the morning.&nbsp;
The trembling sisters, sick with fright, would implore their father
not to expose himself to this danger; but Mr. Bront&euml; is no timid
man, and perhaps he felt that he could possibly influence his son to
some self-restraint, more by showing trust in him than by showing fear.&nbsp;
The sisters often listened for the report of a pistol in the dead of
the night, till watchful eye and hearkening ear grew heavy and dull
with the perpetual strain upon their nerves.&nbsp; In the mornings young
Bront&euml; would saunter out, saying, with a drunkard&rsquo;s incontinence
of speech, &ldquo;The poor old man and I have had a terrible night of
it; he does his best&mdash;the poor old man! but it&rsquo;s all over
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>In the course of this sad autumn of 1845, a new interest came up;
faint, indeed, and often lost sight of in the vivid pain and constant
pressure of anxiety respecting their brother.&nbsp; In the biographical
notice of her sisters, which Charlotte prefixed to the edition of &ldquo;Wuthering
Heights&rdquo; and &ldquo;Agnes Grey,&rdquo; published in 1850&mdash;a
piece of writing unique, as far as I know, in its pathos and its power&mdash;she
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One day in the autumn of 1845, I accidentally
lighted on a MS. volume of verse, in my sister Emily&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp;
Of course, I was not surprised, knowing that she could and did write
verse: I looked it over, and something more than surprise seized me&mdash;a
deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like
the poetry women generally write.&nbsp; I thought them condensed and
terse, vigorous and genuine.&nbsp; To my ear they had also a peculiar
music, wild, melancholy, and elevating.&nbsp; My sister Emily was not
a person of demonstrative character, nor one on the recesses of whose
mind and feelings even those nearest and dearest to her could, with
impunity, intrude unlicensed: it took hours to reconcile her to the
discovery I had made, and days to persuade her that such poems merited
publication . . . Meantime, my younger sister quietly produced some
of her own compositions, intimating that since Emily&rsquo;s had given
me pleasure, I might like to look at hers.&nbsp; I could not but be
a partial judge, yet I thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere
pathos of their own.&nbsp; We had very early cherished the dream of
one day being authors.&nbsp; We agreed to arrange a small selection
of our poems, and, if possible, get them printed.&nbsp; Averse to personal
publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis, and
Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious
scruple at assuming Christian names, positively masculine, while we
did not like to declare ourselves women, because&mdash;without at the
time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is
called &lsquo;feminine,&rsquo; we had a vague impression that authoresses
are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we noticed how critics sometimes
use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their
reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.&nbsp; The bringing out
of our little book was hard work.&nbsp; As was to be expected, neither
we nor our poems were at all wanted; but for this we had been prepared
at the outset; though inexperienced ourselves, we had read the experience
of others.&nbsp; The great puzzle lay in the difficulty of getting answers
of any kind from the publishers to whom we applied.&nbsp; Being greatly
harassed by this obstacle, I ventured to apply to the Messrs. Chambers,
of Edinburgh, for a word of advice; <i>they</i> may have forgotten the
circumstance, but <i>I</i> have not, for from them I received a brief
and business-like, but civil and sensible reply, on which we acted,
and at last made way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I inquired from Mr. Robert Chambers, and found, as Miss Bront&euml;
conjectured, that he had entirely forgotten the application which had
been made to him and his brother for advice; nor had they any copy or
memorandum of the correspondence.</p>
<p>There is an intelligent man living in Haworth, who has given me some
interesting particulars relating to the sisters about this period.&nbsp;
He says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known Miss Bront&euml;, as Miss Bront&euml;, a long
time; indeed, ever since they came to Haworth in 1819.&nbsp; But I had
not much acquaintance with the family till about 1843, when I began
to do a little in the stationery line.&nbsp; Nothing of that kind could
be had nearer than Keighley before I began.&nbsp; They used to buy a
great deal of writing paper, and I used to wonder whatever they did
with so much.&nbsp; I sometimes thought they contributed to the Magazines.&nbsp;
When I was out of stock, I was always afraid of their coming; they seemed
so distressed about it, if I had none.&nbsp; I have walked to Halifax
(a distance of ten miles) many a time, for half a ream of paper, for
fear of being without it when they came.&nbsp; I could not buy more
at a time for want of capital.&nbsp; I was always short of that.&nbsp;
I did so like them to come when I had anything for them; they were so
much different to anybody else; so gentle and kind, and so very quiet.&nbsp;
They never talked much.&nbsp; Charlotte sometimes would sit and inquire
about our circumstances so kindly and feelingly! . . . Though I am a
poor working man (which I have never felt to be any degradation), I
could talk with her with the greatest freedom.&nbsp; I always felt quite
at home with her.&nbsp; Though I never had any school education, I never
felt the want of it in her company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publishers to whom she finally made a successful application
for the production of &ldquo;Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell&rsquo;s poems,&rdquo;
were Messrs. Aylott and Jones, Paternoster Row.&nbsp; Mr. Aylott has
kindly placed the letters which she wrote to them on the subject at
my disposal.&nbsp; The first is dated January 28th, 1846, and in it
she inquires if they will publish one volume octavo of poems; if not
at their own risk, on the author&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; It is signed
&ldquo;C. Bront&euml;.&rdquo;&nbsp; They must have replied pretty speedily,
for on January 31st she writes again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;GENTLEMEN,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you agree to undertake the publication of the work respecting
which I applied to you, I should wish now to know, as soon as possible,
the cost of paper and printing.&nbsp; I will then send the necessary
remittance, together with the manuscript.&nbsp; I should like it to
be printed in one octavo volume, of the same quality of paper and size
of type as Moxon&rsquo;s last edition of Wordsworth.&nbsp; The poems
will occupy, I should think, from 200 to 250 pages.&nbsp; They are not
the production of a clergyman, nor are they exclusively of a religious
character; but I presume these circumstances will be immaterial.&nbsp;
It will, perhaps, be necessary that you should see the manuscript, in
order to calculate accurately the expense of publication; in that case
I will send it immediately.&nbsp; I should like, however, previously,
to have some idea of the probable cost; and if, from what I have said,
you can make a rough calculation on the subject, I should be greatly
obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her next letter, February 6th, she says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will perceive that the poems are the work of three persons,
relatives&mdash;their separate pieces are distinguished by their respective
signatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She writes again on February 15th; and on the 16th she says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The MS. will certainly form a thinner volume than I had anticipated.&nbsp;
I cannot name another model which I should like it precisely to resemble,
yet, I think, a duodecimo form, and a somewhat reduced, though still
<i>clear</i> type, would be preferable.&nbsp; I only stipulate for <i>clear</i>
type, not too small, and good paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On February 21st she selects the &ldquo;long primer type&rdquo; for
the poems, and will remit 31<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. in a few days.</p>
<p>Minute as the details conveyed in these notes are, they are not trivial,
because they afford such strong indications of character.&nbsp; If the
volume was to be published at their own risk, it was necessary that
the sister conducting the negotiation should make herself acquainted
with the different kinds of type, and the various sizes of books.&nbsp;
Accordingly she bought a small volume, from which to learn all she could
on the subject of preparation for the press.&nbsp; No half-knowledge&mdash;no
trusting to other people for decisions which she could make for herself;
and yet a generous and full confidence, not misplaced, in the thorough
probity of Messrs. Aylott and Jones.&nbsp; The caution in ascertaining
the risk before embarking in the enterprise, and the prompt payment
of the money required, even before it could be said to have assumed
the shape of a debt, were both parts of a self-reliant and independent
character.&nbsp; Self-contained also was she.&nbsp; During the whole
time that the volume of poems was in the course of preparation and publication,
no word was written telling anyone, out of the household circle, what
was in progress.</p>
<p>I have had some of the letters placed in my hands, which she addressed
to her old schoolmistress, Miss W-.&nbsp; They begin a little before
this time.&nbsp; Acting on the conviction, which I have all along entertained,
that where Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s own words could be used, no
others ought to take their place, I shall make extracts from this series,
according to their dates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. 30th, 1846.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR MISS W---,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not yet paid my visit to ---; it is, indeed, more than
a year since I was there, but I frequently hear from E., and she did
not fail to tell me that you were gone into Worcestershire; she was
unable, however, to give me your exact address.&nbsp; Had I known it,
I should have written to you long since.&nbsp; I thought you would wonder
how we were getting on, when you heard of the railway panic; and you
may be sure that I am very glad to be able to answer your kind inquiries
by the assurance that our small capital is as yet undiminished.&nbsp;
The York and Midland is, as you say, a very good line, yet, I confess
to you, I should wish, for my own part, to be wise in time.&nbsp; I
cannot think that even the very best lines will continue for many years
at their present premiums; and I have been most anxious for us to sell
our shares ere it be too late, and to secure the proceeds in some safer,
if, for the present, less profitable investment.&nbsp; I cannot, however,
persuade my sisters to regard the affair precisely from my point of
view; and I feel as if I would rather run the risk of loss than hurt
Emily&rsquo;s feelings by acting in direct opposition to her opinion.&nbsp;
She managed in a most handsome and able manner for me, when I was in
Brussels, and prevented by distance from looking after my own interests;
therefore, I will let her manage still, and take the consequences.&nbsp;
Disinterested and energetic she certainly is; and if she be not quite
so tractable or open to conviction as I could wish, I must remember
perfection is not the lot of humanity; and as long as we can regard
those we love, and to whom we are closely allied, with profound and
never-shaken esteem, it is a small thing that they should vex us occasionally
by what appear to us unreasonable and headstrong notions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You, my dear Miss W---, know, full as well as
I do, the value of sisters&rsquo; affection to each other; there is
nothing like it in this world, I believe, when they are nearly equal
in age, and similar in education, tastes, and sentiments.&nbsp; You
ask about Branwell; he never thinks of seeking employment, and I begin
to fear that he has rendered himself incapable of filling any respectable
station in life; besides, if money were at his disposal, he would use
it only to his own injury; the faculty of self-government is, I fear,
almost destroyed in him.&nbsp; You ask me if I do not think that men
are strange beings?&nbsp; I do, indeed.&nbsp; I have often thought so;
and I think, too, that the mode of bringing them up is strange: they
are not sufficiently guarded from temptation.&nbsp; Girls are protected
as if they were something very frail or silly indeed, while boys are
turned loose on the world, as if they, of all beings in existence, were
the wisest and least liable to be led astray.&nbsp; I am glad you like
Broomsgrove, though, I dare say, there are few places you would <i>not</i>
like, with Mrs. M. for a companion.&nbsp; I always feel a peculiar satisfaction
when I hear of your enjoying yourself, because it proves that there
really is such a thing as retributive justice even in this world.&nbsp;
You worked hard; you denied yourself all pleasure, almost all relaxation,
in your youth, and in the prime of life; now you are free, and that
while you have still, I hope, many years of vigour and health in which
you can enjoy freedom.&nbsp; Besides, I have another and very egotistical
motive for being pleased; it seems that even &lsquo;a lone woman&rsquo;
can be happy, as well as cherished wives and proud mothers.&nbsp; I
am glad of that.&nbsp; I speculate much on the existence of unmarried
and never-to-be-married women now-a-days; and I have already got to
the point of considering that there is no more respectable character
on this earth than an unmarried woman, who makes her own way through
life quietly, perseveringly, without support of husband or brother;
and who, having attained the age of forty-five or upwards, retains in
her possession a well-regulated mind, a disposition to enjoy simple
pleasures, and fortitude to support inevitably pains, sympathy with
the sufferings of others, and willingness to relieve want as far as
her means extend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the time that the negotiation with Messrs. Aylott and Co.
was going on, Charlotte went to visit her old school-friend, with whom
she was in such habits of confidential intimacy; but neither then nor
afterwards, did she ever speak to her of the publication of the poems;
nevertheless, this young lady suspected that the sisters wrote for Magazines;
and in this idea she was confirmed when, on one of her visits to Haworth,
she saw Anne with a number of &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Journal,&rdquo;
and a gentle smile of pleasure stealing over her placid face as she
read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
do you smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because I see they have inserted one of my poems,&rdquo;
was the quiet reply; and not a word more was said on the subject.</p>
<p>To this friend Charlotte addressed the following letters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March 3rd, 1846.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reached home a little after two o&rsquo;clock, all safe
and right yesterday; I found papa very well; his sight much the same.&nbsp;
Emily and Anne were going to Keighley to meet me; unfortunately, I had
returned by the old road, while they were gone by the new, and we missed
each other.&nbsp; They did not get home till half-past four, and were
caught in the heavy shower of rain which fell in the afternoon.&nbsp;
I am sorry to say Anne has taken a little cold in consequence, but I
hope she will soon be well.&nbsp; Papa was much cheered by my report
of Mr. C.&rsquo;s opinion, and of old Mrs. E.&rsquo;s experience; but
I could perceive he caught gladly at the idea of deferring the operation
a few months longer.&nbsp; I went into the room where Branwell was,
to speak to him, about an hour after I got home: it was very forced
work to address him.&nbsp; I might have spared myself the trouble, as
he took no notice, and made no reply; he was stupified.&nbsp; My fears
were not in vain.&nbsp; I hear that he got a sovereign while I have
been away, under pretence of paying a pressing debt; he went immediately
and changed it at a public-house, and has employed it as was to be expected.&nbsp;
--- concluded her account by saying he was a &lsquo;hopeless being;&rsquo;
it is too true.&nbsp; In his present state it is scarcely possible to
stay in the room where he is.&nbsp; What the future has in store I do
not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;March 31st, 1846.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our poor old servant Tabby had a sort of fit, a fortnight
since, but is nearly recovered now.&nbsp; Martha&rdquo; (the girl they
had to assist poor old Tabby, and who remains still the faithful servant
at the parsonage,) &ldquo;is ill with a swelling in her knee, and obliged
to go home.&nbsp; I fear it will be long before she is in working condition
again.&nbsp; I received the number of the &lsquo;Record&rsquo; you sent
. . . I read D&rsquo;Aubign&eacute;&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; It is clever,
and in what he says about Catholicism very good.&nbsp; The Evangelical
Alliance part is not very practicable, yet certainly it is more in accordance
with the spirit of the Gospel to preach unity among Christians than
to inculcate mutual intolerance and hatred.&nbsp; I am very glad I went
to&mdash;when I did, for the changed weather has somewhat changed my
health and strength since.&nbsp; How do you get on?&nbsp; I long for
mild south and west winds.&nbsp; I am thankful papa continues pretty
well, though often made very miserable by Branwell&rsquo;s wretched
conduct.&nbsp; <i>There</i>&mdash;there is no change but for the worse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the printing of the volume of poems was quietly proceeding.&nbsp;
After some consultation and deliberation, the sisters had determined
to correct the proofs themselves, Up to March 28th the publishers had
addressed their correspondent as C. Bront&euml;, Esq.; but at this time
some &ldquo;little mistake occurred,&rdquo; and she desired Messrs.
Aylott and Co. in future to direct to her real address, &ldquo;<i>Miss</i>
Bront&euml;,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; She had, however, evidently left it
to be implied that she was not acting on her own behalf, but as agent
for the real authors, since in a note dated April 6th, she makes a proposal
on behalf of &ldquo;C., E., and A. Bell,&rdquo; which is to the following
effect, that they are preparing for the press a work of fiction, consisting
of three distinct and unconnected tales, which may be published either
together, as a work of three volumes, of the ordinary novel size, or
separately, as single volumes, as may be deemed most advisable.&nbsp;
She states, in addition, that it is not their intention to publish these
tales on their own account; but that the authors direct her to ask Messrs.
Aylott and Co. whether they would be disposed to undertake the work,
after having, of course, by due inspection of the MS., ascertained that
its contents are such as to warrant an expectation of success.&nbsp;
To this letter of inquiry the publishers replied speedily, and the tenor
of their answer may be gathered from Charlotte&rsquo;s, dated April
11th.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I beg to thank you, in the name of C., E., and
A. Bell, for your obliging offer of advice.&nbsp; I will avail myself
of it, to request information on two or three points.&nbsp; It is evident
that unknown authors have great difficulties to contend with, before
they can succeed in bringing their works before the public.&nbsp; Can
you give me any hint as to the way in which these difficulties are best
met?&nbsp; For instance, in the present case, where a work of fiction
is in question, in what form would a publisher be most likely to accept
the MS.?&nbsp; Whether offered as a work of three vols., or as tales
which might be published in numbers, or as contributions to a periodical?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What publishers would be most likely to receive favourably
a proposal of this nature?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it suffice to <i>write</i> to a publisher on the subject,
or would it be necessary to have recourse to a personal interview?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your opinion and advice on these three points, or on any other
which your experience may suggest as important, would be esteemed by
us as a favour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident from the whole tenor of this correspondence, that the
truthfulness and probity of the firm of publishers with whom she had
to deal in this her first literary venture, were strongly impressed
upon her mind, and was followed by the inevitable consequence of reliance
on their suggestions.&nbsp; And the progress of the poems was not unreasonably
lengthy or long drawn out.&nbsp; On April 20th she writes to desire
that three copies may be sent to her, and that Messrs. Aylott will advise
her as to the reviewers to whom copies ought to be sent.</p>
<p>I give the next letter as illustrating the ideas of these girls as
to what periodical reviews or notices led public opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poems to be neatly done up in cloth.&nbsp; Have the goodness
to send copies and advertisements, <i>as early as possible</i>, to each
of the undermentioned periodicals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Colburn&rsquo;s New Monthly Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hood&rsquo;s Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jerrold&rsquo;s Shilling Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Edinburgh Review.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tait&rsquo;s Edinburgh Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Dublin University Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also to the &lsquo;Daily News&rsquo; and to the &lsquo;Britannia&rsquo;
papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are any other periodicals to which you have been
in the habit of sending copies of works, let them be supplied also with
copies.&nbsp; I think those I have mentioned will suffice for advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In compliance with this latter request, Messrs. Aylott suggest that
copies and advertisements of the work should be sent to the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Literary Gazette,&rdquo; &ldquo;Critic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Times;&rdquo;
but in her reply Miss Bront&euml; says, that she thinks the periodicals
she first mentioned will be sufficient for advertising in at present,
as the authors do not wish to lay out a larger sum than two pounds in
advertising, esteeming the success of a work dependent more on the notice
it receives from periodicals than on the quantity of advertisements.&nbsp;
In case of any notice of the poems appearing, whether favourable or
otherwise, Messrs. Aylott and Co. are requested to send her the name
and number of those periodicals in which such notices appear; as otherwise,
since she has not the opportunity of seeing periodicals regularly, she
may miss reading the critique.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should the poems be remarked
upon favourably, it is my intention to appropriate a further sum for
advertisements.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, they should pass unnoticed
or be condemned, I consider it would be quite useless to advertise,
as there is nothing, either in the title of the work, or the names of
the authors, to attract attention from a single individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose the little volume of poems was published some time about
the end of May, 1846.&nbsp; It stole into life; some weeks passed over,
without the mighty murmuring public discovering that three more voices
were uttering their speech.&nbsp; And, meanwhile, the course of existence
moved drearily along from day to day with the anxious sisters, who must
have forgotten their sense of authorship in the vital care gnawing at
their hearts.&nbsp; On June 17th, Charlotte writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Branwell declares that he neither can nor will do anything
for himself; good situations have been offered him, for which, by a
fortnight&rsquo;s work, he might have qualified himself, but he will
do nothing except drink and make us all wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um&rdquo; of July 4th, under the head of
poetry for the million, came a short review of the poems of C., E.,
and A. Bell.&nbsp; The reviewer assigns to Ellis the highest rank of
the three &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; as he supposes them to be; he calls
Ellis &ldquo;a fine, quaint spirit;&rdquo; and speaks of &ldquo;an evident
power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again, with some degree of penetration, the reviewer says, that the
poems of Ellis &ldquo;convey an impression of originality beyond what
his contributions to these volumes embody.&rdquo;&nbsp; Currer is placed
midway between Ellis and Acton.&nbsp; But there is little in the review
to strain out, at this distance of time, as worth preserving.&nbsp;
Still, we can fancy with what interest it was read at Haworth Parsonage,
and how the sisters would endeavour to find out reasons for opinions,
or hints for the future guidance of their talents.</p>
<p>I call particular attention to the following letter of Charlotte&rsquo;s,
dated July 10th, 1846.&nbsp; To whom it was written, matters not; but
the wholesome sense of duty in it&mdash;the sense of the supremacy of
that duty which God, in placing us in families, has laid out for us,
seems to deserve especial regard in these days.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see you are in a dilemma, and one of a peculiar
and difficult nature.&nbsp; Two paths lie before you; you conscientiously
wish to choose the right one, even though it be the most steep, strait,
and rugged; but you do not know which is the right one; you cannot decide
whether duty and religion command you to go out into the cold and friendless
world, and there to earn your living by governess drudgery, or whether
they enjoin your continued stay with your aged mother, neglecting, <i>for
the present</i>, every prospect of independency for yourself, and putting
up with daily inconvenience, sometimes even with privations.&nbsp; I
can well imagine, that it is next to impossible for you to decide for
yourself in this matter, so I will decide it for you.&nbsp; At least,
I will tell you what is my earnest conviction on the subject; I will
show you candidly how the question strikes me.&nbsp; The right path
is that which necessitates the greatest sacrifice of self-interest&mdash;which
implies the greatest good to others; and this path, steadily followed,
will lead, I believe, in time, to prosperity and to happiness, though
it may seem, at the outset, to tend quite in a contrary direction.&nbsp;
Your mother is both old and infirm; old and infirm people have but few
sources of happiness&mdash;fewer almost than the comparatively young
and healthy can conceive; to deprive them of one of these is cruel.&nbsp;
If your mother is more composed when you are with her, stay with her.&nbsp;
If she would be unhappy in case you left her, stay with her.&nbsp; It
will not apparently, as far as short-sighted humanity can see, be for
your advantage to remain at ---, nor will you be praised and admired
for remaining at home to comfort your mother; yet, probably, your own
conscience will approve, and if it does, stay with her.&nbsp; I recommend
you to do what I am trying to do myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of this letter is only interesting to the reader as
it conveys a peremptory disclaimer of the report that the writer was
engaged to be married to her father&rsquo;s curate&mdash;the very same
gentleman to whom, eight years afterwards, she was united; and who,
probably, even now, although she was unconscious of the fact, had begun
his service to her, in the same tender and faithful spirit as that in
which Jacob served for Rachel.&nbsp; Others may have noticed this, though
she did not.</p>
<p>A few more notes remain of her correspondence &ldquo;on behalf of
the Messrs. Bell&rdquo; with Mr. Aylott.&nbsp; On July 15th she says,
&ldquo;I suppose, as you have not written, no other notices have yet
appeared, nor has the demand for the work increased.&nbsp; Will you
favour me with a line stating whether <i>any</i>, or how many copies
have yet been sold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But few, I fear; for, three days later, she wrote the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Messrs. Bell desire me to thank you for your suggestion
respecting the advertisements.&nbsp; They agree with you that, since
the season is unfavourable, advertising had better be deferred.&nbsp;
They are obliged to you for the information respecting the number of
copies sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On July 23rd she writes to the Messrs. Aylott:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Messrs. Bell would be obliged to you to post the enclosed
note in London.&nbsp; It is an answer to the letter you forwarded, which
contained an application for their autographs from a person who professed
to have read and admired their poems.&nbsp; I think I before intimated,
that the Messrs. Bell are desirous for the present of remaining unknown,
for which reason they prefer having the note posted in London to sending
it direct, in order to avoid giving any clue to residence, or identity
by post-mark, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, in September, she writes, &ldquo;As the work has received
no further notice from any periodical, I presume the demand for it has
not greatly increased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the biographical notice of her sisters, she thus speaks of the
failure of the modest hopes vested in this publication.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
book was printed; it is scarcely known, and all of it that merits to
be known are the poems of Ellis Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fixed conviction I held, and hold, of the worth of these
poems, has not, indeed, received the confirmation of much favourable
criticism; but I must retain it notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>
<p><a name="footnote1"></a><a href="#citation1">{1}</a>&nbsp; A reviewer
pointed out the discrepancy between the age (twenty-seven years) assigned,
on the mural tablet, to Anne Bront&euml; at the time of her death in
1849, and the alleged fact that she was born at Thornton, from which
place Mr. Bront&euml; removed on February 25th, 1820.&nbsp; I was aware
of the discrepancy, but I did not think it of sufficient consequence
to be rectified by an examination of the register of births.&nbsp; Mr.
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s own words, on which I grounded my statement as to
the time of Anne Bront&euml;&rsquo;s birth, are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Thornton, Charlotte, Patrick Branwell, Emily Jane, and
Anne were born.&rdquo;&nbsp; And such of the inhabitants of Haworth
as have spoken on the subject say that all the children of Mr. and Mrs.
Bront&euml; were born before they removed to Haworth.&nbsp; There is
probably some mistake in the inscription on the tablet.</p>
<p><a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#citation2">{2}</a>&nbsp; In the
month of April 1858, a neat mural tablet was erected within the Communion
railing of the Church at Haworth, to the memory of the deceased members
of the Bront&euml; family.&nbsp; The tablet is of white Carrara marble
on a ground of dove-coloured marble, with a cornice surmounted by an
ornamental pediment of chaste design.&nbsp; Between the brackets which
support the tablet, is inscribed the sacred monogram I.H.S., in old
English letters.</p>
<p>In Memory of</p>
<p>Maria, wife of the Rev. P. Bront&euml;, A.B., Minister of Haworth,</p>
<p>She died Sept. 15th, 1821, in the 39th year of her age.</p>
<p>Also, of Maria, their daughter, who died May 6th, 1825, in the 12th
year of her age.</p>
<p>Also, of Elizabeth, their daughter, who died June 15th, 1825, in
the 11th year of her age.</p>
<p>Also, of Patrick Branwell, their son, who died Sept. 24th, 1848,
aged 31 years.</p>
<p>Also, of Emily Jane, their daughter, who died Dec. 19th, 1848, aged
30 years.</p>
<p>Also, of Anne, their daughter, who died May 28th, 1849, aged 29 years.&nbsp;
She was buried at the Old Church, Scarborough.</p>
<p>Also, of Charlotte, their daughter, wife of the Rev. A. B. Nicholls,
B.A.&nbsp; She died March 31st, 1855, in the 39th year of her age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the

<p><a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#citation3">{3}</a>&nbsp; With regard
to my own opinion of the present school, I can only give it as formed
after what was merely a cursory and superficial inspection, as I do
not believe that I was in the house above half an hour; but it was and
is this,&mdash;that the house at Casterton seemed thoroughly healthy
and well kept, and is situated in a lovely spot; that the pupils looked
bright, happy, and well, and that the lady superintendent was a most
prepossessing looking person, who, on my making some inquiry as to the
accomplishments taught to the pupils, said that the scheme of education
was materially changed since the school had been opened.&nbsp; I would
have inserted this testimony in the first edition, had I believed that
any weight could be attached to an opinion formed on such slight and
superficial grounds.</p>

describes the sport, &ldquo;Shooting at the Popinjay,&rdquo; &ldquo;as
an ancient game formerly practised with archery, but at this period
(1679) with firearms.&nbsp; This was the figure of a bird decked with
parti-coloured feathers, so as to resemble a popinjay or parrot.&nbsp;
It was suspended to a pole, and served for a mark at which the competitors
discharged their fusees and carbines in rotation, at the distance of
seventy paces.&nbsp; He whose ball brought down the mark held the proud
title of Captain of the Popinjay for the remainder of the day, and was
usually escorted in triumph to the most respectable change-house in
the neighbourhood, where the evening was closed with conviviality, conducted
under his auspices, and if he was able to maintain it, at his expense.&rdquo;&mdash;Old

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
